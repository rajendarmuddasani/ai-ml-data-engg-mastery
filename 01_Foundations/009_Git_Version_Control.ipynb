    "## 📚 What is Git & Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version control** is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling you to recall specific versions, collaborate effectively, and maintain code quality. **Git** is the de facto standard distributed version control system used by 95% of software teams worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Git for AI/ML?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Collaboration**: 10-100 engineers working on same codebase (Intel: 250+ engineers on AI platform)\n",
    "- ✅ **Reproducibility**: Track exact code version that trained a model (NVIDIA: \"Which commit produced model v2.3?\")\n",
    "- ✅ **Experimentation**: Branch for experiments without breaking production (AMD: 50+ feature branches active)\n",
    "- ✅ **Code Review**: Pull requests ensure quality before merge (Qualcomm: 98% bugs caught in review)\n",
    "- ✅ **Rollback**: Instantly revert bad deployments (Meta: rollback in <5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control != Just Git:**\n",
    "- **Code**: Git tracks `.py`, `.ipynb`, config files\n",
    "- **Data**: DVC (Data Version Control) tracks datasets, models (>100MB files)\n",
    "- **Experiments**: MLflow tracks hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts\n",
    "- **Models**: Model registry (MLflow, SageMaker) tracks production models\n",

    "- `release/*`: Release preparation (branch from develop)\n",
    "- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes (branch from main)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Scheduled releases (quarterly, monthly)\n",
    "- ✅ Multiple versions in production\n",
    "- ✅ Large teams (50+ engineers)\n",
    "- ✅ High stability requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intel Example:**\n",
    "- 250 engineers, 20 products\n",
    "- `main`: Released silicon test programs\n",
    "- `develop`: Next-generation features\n",
    "- `feature/ddr5-test`: New DDR5 memory tests\n",

    "- `hotfix/critical-bug`: Fix production issue\n",
    "- **Result**: 95% fewer production bugs, clear release process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Trunk-Based Development** (Fast-Moving Teams)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- `main`: Single source of truth (always deployable)\n",
    "- Short-lived feature branches (<2 days)\n",
    "- Feature flags for incomplete features\n",
    "- Continuous integration + daily commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout feature\n",
    "git rebase main\n",
    "# Replays commits on top of main\n",
    "```\n",

    "- ❌ Rewrites history (dangerous if shared)\n",
    "- ❌ Conflicts must be resolved per commit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",

    "## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Workflow Decision Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "| Team Size | Project Type | Recommended Workflow | Branch Strategy |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| 1-3 | Personal/prototype | **Feature Branch** | main + feature/* |\n",
    "| 4-10 | Startup/product | **Gitflow** | main + develop + feature/* + release/* |\n",
    "| 10-50 | Enterprise | **Gitflow** or **Forking** | + hotfix/* branches |\n",
    "| 50+ | Open source | **Forking** | Fork-based contributions |\n",
    "| Any | High velocity | **Trunk-Based** | main only + feature flags |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commit Best Practices ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventional Commits Format:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<type>(<scope>): <description>\n",
    "\n",
    "[optional body]\n",
    "\n",
    "[optional footer]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "- `feat`: New feature\n",
    "- `fix`: Bug fix\n",
    "- `docs`: Documentation only\n",
    "- `style`: Formatting, no logic change\n",
    "- `refactor`: Code restructure, no behavior change\n",
    "- `test`: Add/modify tests\n",
    "- `chore`: Maintenance (dependencies, build)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "feat(parser): add support for STDF v4 format\n",
    "fix(wafer-map): correct die coordinate calculation\n",
    "docs(readme): update installation instructions for Python 3.11\n",
    "test(yield): add edge case tests for 0% and 100% yield\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merge Strategy Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Use When | Avoid When |\n",
    "|----------|----------|------------|\n",
    "| **Fast-Forward** | Clean history, no conflicts | Want to preserve feature branch context |\n",
    "| **3-Way Merge** | Preserve full history | History becomes too complex |\n",
    "| **Rebase** | Clean linear history critical | Working on shared branch (force push risky) |\n",
    "| **Squash** | Many small commits, want clean main | Need detailed commit history |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch Protection Rules 🔒\n",
    "\n",
    "**For `main` branch:**\n",
    "- ✅ Require pull request reviews (min 2 approvals)\n",
    "- ✅ Require status checks to pass (CI/CD pipeline)\n",
    "- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging\n",
    "- ✅ Restrict force pushes\n",
    "- ✅ Restrict deletions\n",
    "\n",
    "**For `develop` branch:**\n",
    "- ✅ Require pull request reviews (min 1 approval)\n",
    "- ✅ Require status checks to pass\n",
    "- ❌ Allow force push (for rebasing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Performance Tips ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Large Repositories:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Partial clone (faster, less disk space)\n",
    "git clone --filter=blob:none <repo-url>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shallow clone (only recent history)\n",
    "git clone --depth=1 <repo-url>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sparse checkout (only specific folders)\n",
    "git sparse-checkout set src/ tests/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Large Files:**\n",
    "- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for binaries, models, datasets\n",
    "- Add to `.gitattributes`: `*.stdf filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text`\n",
    "- Configure LFS: `git lfs install`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Silicon Validation Git Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/semiconductor-test-automation\n",
    "├── .github/\n",
    "│   └── workflows/          # CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "├── test-scripts/\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching Strategy:**\n",
    "- `main`: Production test scripts (validated on real equipment)\n",
    "- `staging`: Pre-production testing\n",
    "- `feature/parametric-test-v2`: New test development\n",
    "- `hotfix/current-limit-fix`: Urgent production fixes\n",
    "- Tags: `v1.0-wafer-test`, `v1.1-final-test`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-commit Checks:**\n",
    "- Validate test parameter ranges (voltage, current, frequency)\n",
    "- Check STDF file path references\n",
    "- Run syntax validation on test scripts\n",
    "- Ensure no hardcoded IP addresses or credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **❌ Committing Secrets**\n",
    "   - Problem: API keys, passwords in code\n",
    "   - Solution: Use environment variables, `.env` files in `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **❌ Large Binary Files**\n",
    "   - Problem: Slows down clone, bloats repository\n",
    "   - Solution: Git LFS for models/data, build artifacts in `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **❌ Merge vs Rebase Confusion**\n",
    "   - Problem: Messy history or lost commits\n",
    "   - Solution: Rebase feature branches, merge to main\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **❌ Detached HEAD State**\n",
    "   - Problem: Commits not on any branch\n",
    "   - Solution: Create branch before committing: `git checkout -b recovery`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **❌ Force Push on Shared Branch**\n",
    "   - Problem: Overwrites others' work\n",
    "   - Solution: Never force push to `main`/`develop`, only on personal branches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "**Master Git:**\n",
    "1. Practice: Clone open-source project, make contribution\n",
    "2. Setup: Configure Git hooks for your projects\n",
    "3. Learn: Advanced rebasing (`git rebase -i`), cherry-picking\n",
    "4. Tools: Try GitKraken, SourceTree for visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue Learning:**\n",
    "- **Next:** `048_Model_Deployment.ipynb` - Deploy code with Git-based CI/CD\n",
    "- **Advanced:** Container-based deployments with Git workflows\n",
    "- **Read:** \"Pro Git\" book (free online), Git documentation\n",
