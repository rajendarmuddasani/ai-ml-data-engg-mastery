# 01 - Foundations

**Purpose:** Core programming and algorithmic foundations for AI/ML mastery

## Notebooks

- **001_DSA_Python_Mastery.ipynb** - Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- **002_Python_Advanced_Concepts.ipynb** - Decorators, generators, context managers, metaprogramming, async/await

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Master Python programming at advanced level
- Understand time/space complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Implement common data structures from scratch
- Apply algorithmic thinking to optimization problems
- Build efficient, production-ready code

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python syntax
- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)

## Next Steps

After completing this section, move to **02_Regression_Models** to start ML journey.
