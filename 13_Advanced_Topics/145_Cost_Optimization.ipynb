    "# 145: Cost Optimization - Resource Right-Sizing, Spot Instances, and FinOps\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** cloud cost structure and optimization opportunities (compute 40-50%, storage 20-30%, data transfer 10-20%)\n",
    "- **Implement** right-sizing analysis to eliminate over-provisioned instances (40% of instances over-provisioned by 2-4x, 50% savings potential)\n",
    "- **Deploy** spot instances for batch workloads with checkpointing (70% discount, handle 2-minute interruptions)\n",
    "- **Optimize** with reserved instances and savings plans (40-60% discount for stable workloads)\n",
    "- **Apply** hybrid pricing strategy to semiconductor test infrastructure (60% reserved + 30% spot + 10% on-demand = 60-80% total savings)\n",
    "- **Build** FinOps dashboards with cost allocation, budgets, and anomaly detection (visibility drives accountability)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Cost Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost optimization** is the discipline of **maximizing cloud ROI** by eliminating waste, selecting optimal pricing models, and implementing governance. Unlike cost cutting (reducing capabilities), cost optimization **maintains or improves performance** while reducing spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud costs typically follow the **80-20 rule**: 80% of spend comes from 20% of resources. Key optimization areas:\n",
    "- **Compute (40-50% of bill)**: Right-sizing over-provisioned instances, spot instances for batch jobs, reserved instances for baseline\n",
    "- **Storage (20-30%)**: Lifecycle policies (move to cheaper tiers), compression (70% size reduction), data retention (delete old data)\n",
    "- **Data transfer (10-20%)**: Same-region architecture, CDN caching, compression, VPC endpoints\n",
    "- **Waste (10-20%)**: Unused resources (unattached volumes, idle load balancers, forgotten snapshots), dev/staging running 24/7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unoptimized vs Optimized Cloud Spend:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Unoptimized | Optimized | Strategy | Savings |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| **Compute** | $50,000/month | $8,000/month | Right-sizing + Spot + Reserved + Auto-scaling | 84% ($42K saved) |\n",
    "| **Storage** | $15,000/month | $3,000/month | Lifecycle policies + Compression + Retention | 80% ($12K saved) |\n",
    "| **Data Transfer** | $20,000/month | $4,000/month | Same-region + CDN + Compression + VPC endpoints | 80% ($16K saved) |\n",
    "| **Waste** | $40,000/month | $2,000/month | Auto-shutdown dev/staging + Delete unused resources | 95% ($38K saved) |\n",
    "| **TOTAL** | **$125,000/month** | **$17,000/month** | **Comprehensive optimization** | **86% ($108K/month saved)** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Cost Optimization?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Maximize ROI**: Every dollar saved on infrastructure is a dollar available for innovation (new features, more experiments)\n",
    "- ✅ **Competitive advantage**: Lower costs enable aggressive pricing, faster experimentation, more budget for R&D\n",
    "- ✅ **Sustainability**: Reduced resource consumption lowers carbon footprint (right-sizing reduces energy usage)\n",
    "- ✅ **Financial accountability**: FinOps practices (budgets, chargeback) enforce cost-conscious engineering culture\n",

    "## 2. 📏 Resource Right-Sizing - Optimize Instance Types and Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose:** Eliminate waste from over-provisioned instances by matching resources to actual usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Right-Sizing**: Match instance type to actual workload requirements (CPU, memory, network, storage)\n",
    "- **Over-Provisioning**: Using m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM) when m5.large (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) sufficient (wasting 75% of capacity)\n",
    "- **Under-Provisioning**: Using t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) when m5.xlarge needed (CPU throttling, OOM errors, poor performance)\n",
    "- **Utilization Target**: 60-80% utilization (not 95% = no headroom for spikes, not 20% = wasting money)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance Family Selection:**\n",
    "- **General purpose (m5, m6i)**: Balanced CPU/memory ratio (1:4), good for most workloads\n",
    "- **Compute-optimized (c5, c6i)**: Higher CPU ratio (1:2), good for batch processing, ML training\n",
    "- **Memory-optimized (r5, r6i)**: Higher memory ratio (1:8), good for databases, caching, big data\n",
    "- **GPU instances (p3, p4, g4)**: For ML training/inference, choose based on memory needs (p3.2xlarge: 16GB, p3.8xlarge: 64GB)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Right-Sizing Matters:**\n",
    "- **Eliminate waste**: 40% of instances over-provisioned by 2-4x (using m5.2xlarge when m5.large sufficient)\n",
    "- **Quick wins**: Right-sizing m5.2xlarge → m5.xlarge saves 50% ($0.384/hour → $0.192/hour) with zero code changes\n",
    "- **Continuous process**: Usage patterns change over time (traffic grows, new features added), re-evaluate quarterly\n",
    "- **Low risk**: Can easily upsize if needed (2 minutes to change instance type, test in staging first)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:**\n",
    "- **STDF parser**: Profiling shows 25% CPU usage on m5.2xlarge → downsize to m5.large (50% savings, $2,800/month)\n",
    "- **ML training**: GPU utilization 20% on p3.8xlarge (4 GPUs) → downsize to p3.2xlarge (1 GPU, 75% savings, $6,600/month)\n",
    "- **Database**: Memory usage 40% on r5.2xlarge (64GB) → downsize to r5.xlarge (32GB, 50% savings, $3,650/month)\n",
    "- **Web servers**: 10% CPU usage on c5.xlarge → downsize to c5.large (50% savings, $1,500/month)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-Sizing Process:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Collect metrics**: CloudWatch 2-week average CPU, memory, network, disk (capture normal + peak periods)\n",
    "- ✅ **Identify candidates**: Instances with <40% CPU or <50% memory for 2+ weeks\n",
    "- ✅ **Calculate savings**: Compare current cost vs right-sized cost (m5.2xlarge $277/month → m5.large $139/month)\n",
    "- ✅ **Test in staging**: Downsize staging first, run load tests, validate performance\n",
    "- ✅ **Implement gradually**: Downsize 10% of production fleet, monitor for 1 week, rollout remaining 90%"

    "## 3. ⚡ Spot Instances - 70% Cost Savings for Batch Workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What Are Spot Instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot instances** are spare cloud capacity available at up to **70% discount** compared to on-demand pricing. The trade-off: **2-minute interruption notice** when capacity is needed back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Pricing**: 70-90% cheaper than on-demand (e.g., m5.2xlarge: $0.384/hour → $0.12/hour)\n",
    "- **Availability**: Varies by region and instance type (check spot pricing history)\n",
    "- **Interruption**: 2-minute warning when AWS needs capacity back\n",
    "- **Use case**: Fault-tolerant workloads (batch jobs, ML training, ETL pipelines)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Spot Instances for Post-Silicon Validation:**\n",
    "- ✅ **STDF ETL batch processing**: Process 100K wafers overnight, save 82% vs on-demand\n",
    "- ✅ **ML model training**: Train yield prediction models, checkpoint every 5 minutes, resume on interruption\n",
    "- ✅ **Parametric data analysis**: Run statistical analysis on test data, retry failed jobs automatically\n",
    "- ✅ **Wafer map rendering**: Generate 10K wafer maps for reports, parallelizable and idempotent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Spot Instance Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Diversification Strategy:**\n",
    "- Use **multiple instance types** (m5.xlarge, m5a.xlarge, m5n.xlarge) to increase availability\n",
    "- Use **multiple availability zones** (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c) to reduce interruption risk\n",
    "- AWS will provision from lowest-price, highest-availability pool\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Checkpointing for Long Jobs:**\n",
    "- Save progress every 5-10 minutes (ML model checkpoints, ETL batch markers)\n",
    "- Resume from last checkpoint on interruption (lose <5 minutes of work)\n",
    "- Store checkpoints in S3 (persistent, independent of spot instance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Interruption Handling:**\n",
    "- Listen to **EC2 spot interruption notice** (CloudWatch Event or metadata endpoint)\n",
    "- Graceful shutdown in <2 minutes (save state, upload results, terminate cleanly)\n",
    "- Auto-retry on new spot instance (AWS Batch, Kubernetes spot node groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cost-Aware Bidding:**\n",
    "- Use **capacity-optimized** allocation strategy (prioritize pools with least interruption risk)\n",
    "- Set max price = on-demand price (willing to pay up to on-demand, get spot discount when available)\n",
    "- Monitor spot pricing trends (avoid volatile pools, prefer stable pricing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Spot Instance Cost Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: STDF ETL Batch Processing (20 instances, 24/7)**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Configuration | Instance Type | Pricing Model | Hourly Rate | Monthly Cost | Savings |\n",
    "|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Unoptimized** | m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32GB) | On-demand 24/7 | $0.384/hour | $7,372/month | Baseline |\n",
    "| **Spot instances** | m5.2xlarge | Spot (70% discount) | $0.12/hour | $2,304/month | 69% ($5,068 saved) |\n",
    "| **Spot + auto-shutdown** | m5.2xlarge | Spot nights only (12h/day) | $0.12/hour | $1,290/month | 82% ($6,082 saved) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** Combining spot instances (70% discount) with auto-shutdown (50% time reduction) yields **82% total savings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ When NOT to Use Spot Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid spot for:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Stateful services**: Databases, caches, message queues (state loss on interruption)\n",
    "- ❌ **Real-time workloads**: Production APIs, live dashboards (latency-sensitive)\n",
    "- ❌ **Long-running transactions**: >2-hour jobs without checkpointing (lose too much work)\n",
    "- ❌ **Low-tolerance workloads**: Critical pipelines with strict SLAs (interruption risk unacceptable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot is perfect for:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Batch processing**: ETL, data pipelines, log analysis (fault-tolerant)\n",
    "- ✅ **ML training**: Checkpointed training runs (resume on interruption)\n",
    "- ✅ **CI/CD builds**: Unit tests, integration tests (stateless, retry on failure)\n",
    "- ✅ **Rendering/encoding**: Video encoding, image processing (parallelizable)\n",

    "## 4. 📅 Reserved Instances & Savings Plans - 40% Discount for Stable Workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What Are Reserved Instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reserved instances (RIs)** provide **40-60% discount** vs on-demand in exchange for **1-year or 3-year commitment**. Best for predictable, steady-state workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Commitment**: 1-year (40% discount) or 3-year (60% discount)\n",
    "- **Payment**: All upfront (max discount), partial upfront, or no upfront\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Standard RIs (lowest price, fixed instance type) or Convertible RIs (moderate discount, can change instance type)\n",
    "- **Use case**: Production databases, APIs, ML inference endpoints (always-on services)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reserved Instance Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Discount | Commitment | Flexibility | Best For |\n",
    "|------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Standard RI** | 60% (3-year) | Fixed instance type/region | None (locked in) | Stable production workloads |\n",
    "| **Convertible RI** | 45% (3-year) | Can change instance type | High (swap anytime) | Evolving workloads |\n",
    "| **Scheduled RI** | 30% | Specific schedule (e.g., 9am-5pm weekdays) | Moderate | Predictable schedules |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Reserved Instances for Post-Silicon Validation:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Production ML inference**: Yield prediction API runs 24/7, save 40% with 1-year RI\n",
    "- ✅ **Database servers**: PostgreSQL for STDF metadata, always-on, save 60% with 3-year RI\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitoring infrastructure**: Prometheus, Grafana always-on, stable sizing, save 40%\n",
    "- ✅ **Web application servers**: Dashboard for wafer maps, predictable traffic, save 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Savings Plans (Flexible Alternative to RIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Savings Plans** offer same discounts as RIs but with **more flexibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute Savings Plans:**\n",
    "- Discount: Up to 66% (3-year commitment)\n",
    "- Flexibility: Apply to any instance family, size, region, or OS\n",
    "- Commitment: Hourly spend (e.g., $10/hour) instead of specific instance type\n",
    "- Best for: Dynamic workloads that change instance types\n",
    "\n",
    "**EC2 Instance Savings Plans:**\n",
    "- Discount: Up to 72% (3-year commitment)\n",
    "- Flexibility: Apply to specific instance family in specific region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1)\n",
    "- Commitment: Hourly spend for instance family\n",
    "- Best for: Predictable workloads within same instance family\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Commit to $10/hour of compute for 1 year = 40% discount on all compute up to $10/hour (applies to m5, c5, r5, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Reserved Instance ROI Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Production ML Inference (10 m5.xlarge instances, 24/7)**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pricing Model | Configuration | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Savings |\n",
    "|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **On-Demand** | 10 × m5.xlarge @ $0.192/hour | $14,016/month | $168,192/year | Baseline |\n",
    "| **1-Year Standard RI** (All Upfront) | 10 × m5.xlarge @ 40% discount | $8,410/month | $100,915/year | 40% ($67,277 saved) |\n",
    "| **3-Year Standard RI** (All Upfront) | 10 × m5.xlarge @ 60% discount | $5,606/month | $67,277/year | 60% ($100,915 saved) |\n",
    "| **Compute Savings Plan** (1-Year) | $10/hour commitment | $9,125/month | $109,500/year | 35% ($58,692 saved) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Best ROI**: 3-year Standard RI (60% discount) if workload is stable for 3 years\n",
    "- **Best flexibility**: Compute Savings Plan (35% discount) if instance types may change\n",
    "- **Low risk**: 1-year RI (40% discount) for evolving workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ When NOT to Use Reserved Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid RIs for:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Variable workloads**: Traffic spikes/drops (use auto-scaling with on-demand/spot)\n",
    "- ❌ **Development/testing**: Environments shut down nights/weekends (use auto-shutdown)\n",
    "- ❌ **Short-term projects**: <6 months duration (commitment longer than usage)\n",
    "- ❌ **Rapidly changing architecture**: Migrating from m5 to c6g (use Compute Savings Plan instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RIs are perfect for:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Baseline capacity**: 80% of fleet is always-on, buy RIs for baseline, use spot/on-demand for spikes\n",
    "- ✅ **Production databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL always-on (60% savings with 3-year RI)\n",
    "- ✅ **ML inference endpoints**: SageMaker endpoints serving real-time predictions (40% savings)\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitoring/logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack always-on (40% savings)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Reserved Instance Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid Approach** (Maximize Savings + Flexibility):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline capacity (60%)**: Reserved Instances (40-60% discount)\n",
    "   - Always-on production services (databases, APIs, ML inference)\n",
    "   - Stable sizing, predictable usage\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable capacity (30%)**: Spot Instances (70% discount)\n",
    "   - Batch processing, ML training, ETL pipelines\n",
    "   - Fault-tolerant, checkpointed workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Peak capacity (10%)**: On-Demand (full price)\n",
    "   - Traffic spikes, failover capacity\n",
    "   - Pay for flexibility when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Fleet:**\n",
    "- 50 instances total\n",
    "- 30 Reserved (baseline production) @ 40% discount = $4,200/month\n",
    "- 15 Spot (batch/training) @ 70% discount = $900/month\n",
    "- 5 On-Demand (spikes) @ full price = $700/month\n",
    "- **Total: $5,800/month vs $14,000 on-demand (59% savings)**\n",

    "**Three Pillars of Cost Optimization:**\n",
    "- **Right-Sizing** (40% of instances over-provisioned) → 50% savings potential\n",
    "- **Pricing Models** (spot 70% discount, reserved 40-60% discount) → 60% savings potential\n",
    "- **Resource Lifecycle** (auto-shutdown, storage tiering, data retention) → 70% savings potential\n",

    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-Sizing:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Collect 2+ weeks of metrics** before downsizing (CPU, memory, network, disk)\n",
    "- ✅ **Target 60-80% utilization** (not 95% = no headroom, not 20% = waste)\n",
    "- ✅ **Test in staging first** (downsize staging, run load tests, validate performance)\n",
    "- ✅ **Implement gradually** (10% of fleet → monitor 1 week → rollout 90%)\n",
    "- ✅ **Keep snapshots** (easy rollback if performance degrades, upsize in 2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Instances:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Checkpoint every 5-10 minutes** (save progress to S3, resume on interruption)\n",
    "- ✅ **Diversify instance types** (5+ types: m5.xlarge, m5a.xlarge, m5n.xlarge, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ **Diversify availability zones** (3+ AZs: us-east-1a, 1b, 1c for 99%+ availability)\n",
    "- ✅ **Listen to interruption notice** (EC2 metadata endpoint, 2-minute warning)\n",
    "- ✅ **Graceful shutdown** (save checkpoint, upload results, terminate in <2 minutes)\n",
    "- ✅ **Capacity-optimized allocation** (AWS selects pools with least interruption risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reserved Instances:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Analyze 30-day usage** (identify instances with >80% uptime = baseline capacity)\n",
    "- ✅ **Start with 1-year RIs** (40% discount, lower commitment risk, can reassess yearly)\n",
    "- ✅ **Use 3-year RIs for stable workloads** (60% discount, max savings, production databases)\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitor RI utilization** (alert if <80%, sell unused RIs on marketplace)\n",
    "- ✅ **Consider Compute Savings Plans** (35% discount, more flexibility than RIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-Shutdown:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Tag-based targeting** (auto-shutdown all `Environment=dev/staging`, exclude production)\n",
    "- ✅ **Weekday schedules** (8am-6pm = 50 hours/week vs 168 hours/week = 70% savings)\n",
    "- ✅ **Manual override** (engineers can tag `AutoShutdown=false` for special needs)\n",
    "- ✅ **Slack notifications** (warn 15 minutes before shutdown, reduce surprises)\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost tracking** (measure monthly savings, dashboard showing compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Lifecycle:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Lifecycle policies** (Standard → IA after 30 days → Glacier after 90 days → Deep Archive after 1 year)\n",
    "- ✅ **Compression** (gzip STDF files 70% size reduction, parquet for analytics)\n",
    "- ✅ **Intelligent tiering** (auto-move to lowest-cost tier based on access patterns)\n",
    "- ✅ **Data retention** (auto-delete >2-year-old test data, compliance-approved)\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost tracking** (monitor by tier, identify large buckets, optimize high-cost storage)\n",
    "\n",
    "**FinOps:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Tag all resources** (team, product, environment, cost center for chargeback)\n",
    "- ✅ **Set budgets** (monthly budgets per team, alert at 80%, 100%, 120%)\n",
    "- ✅ **Anomaly detection** (ML model for unusual spend spikes, alert within 1 hour)\n",
    "- ✅ **Quarterly reviews** (team-level cost reviews, identify optimization opportunities)\n",
    "- ✅ **Optimization recommendations** (automated suggestions for right-sizing, RI coverage, spot)\n",

    "### 🚀 Advanced Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Account Cost Allocation:**\n",
    "- **AWS Organizations** with consolidated billing (volume discounts, centralized RI purchasing)\n",
    "- **Cost allocation tags** propagate to all accounts (team, product, environment)\n",
    "- **Chargeback reports** per account (dev team pays for their resources, enforces accountability)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Fleet Diversification:**\n",
    "- **5+ instance types** (m5.xlarge, m5a.xlarge, m5n.xlarge, m5ad.xlarge, m5d.xlarge)\n",
    "- **3+ availability zones** (us-east-1a, 1b, 1c for redundancy)\n",
    "- **Capacity-optimized-prioritized** (order instance types by preference, AWS fills from top)\n",
    "- **Fallback to on-demand** if spot unavailable (maintain SLA, accept higher cost temporarily)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Cost Optimization:**\n",
    "- **Right-size RDS instances** (db.r5.4xlarge → db.r5.2xlarge if CPU <40%, 50% savings)\n",
    "- **Read replicas** for read-heavy queries (add 2 replicas, 3x read throughput)\n",
    "- **Reserved Instances** for production (60% discount with 3-year commitment)\n",
    "- **Storage optimization** (GP3 instead of IO1, 50% cheaper for same IOPS)\n",
    "- **Aurora Serverless** for variable workloads (auto-scale compute, pay per second)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transfer Optimization:**\n",
    "- **Same-region architecture** (deploy compute + storage in same region, eliminate cross-region $0.02/GB)\n",
    "- **CloudFront CDN** (cache static assets at edge, 80% cache hit rate, reduce origin bandwidth)\n",
    "- **Compression** (gzip API responses, 70% size reduction, reduce bandwidth)\n",
    "- **VPC endpoints** (S3 VPC endpoint eliminates NAT gateway $0.045/GB transfer cost)\n",
    "- **Direct Connect** for large transfers (dedicated 1Gbps+ link, cheaper than internet transfer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kubernetes Cost Optimization:**\n",
    "- **Cluster autoscaler** (scale nodes 0 → 100 based on pod demand)\n",
    "- **Spot node groups** (70% discount for stateless pods, graceful pod eviction on interruption)\n",
    "- **Reserved node groups** (40% discount for baseline capacity, always-on system pods)\n",
    "- **Resource requests/limits** (right-size pods, bin-pack efficiently, avoid wasted CPU/memory)\n",
    "- **Namespace quotas** (limit resources per team, prevent runaway costs)\n",

    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-Sizing Mistakes:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Downsizing without testing** - Performance degradation in production (always test in staging first)\n",
    "- ❌ **Targeting 95% utilization** - No headroom for spikes (target 60-80%, leave 20-40% buffer)\n",
    "- ❌ **Ignoring memory** - Only looking at CPU (memory can be bottleneck, check both)\n",
    "- ❌ **One-time analysis** - Not re-evaluating quarterly (workloads change, re-analyze every 3 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Instance Mistakes:**\n",
    "- ❌ **No checkpointing** - Losing hours of work on interruption (checkpoint every 5-10 minutes)\n",
    "- ❌ **Single instance type** - High interruption rate (diversify 5+ types for 99%+ availability)\n",
    "- ❌ **Production databases** on spot - State loss unacceptable (use on-demand or reserved for stateful)\n",
    "- ❌ **No fallback** - Job fails if spot unavailable (fall back to on-demand, accept higher cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reserved Instance Mistakes:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Over-committing** - Buying 100 RIs when only 60 needed (monitor utilization, start small)\n",
    "- ❌ **Wrong instance type** - Buying m5.2xlarge RIs when using c5.xlarge (match actual usage)\n",
    "- ❌ **Ignoring flexibility** - Standard RI when Compute Savings Plan better (Savings Plans more flexible)\n",
    "- ❌ **Not monitoring utilization** - RIs sitting unused (track utilization, sell on marketplace if <80%)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-Shutdown Mistakes:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Shutting down production** - Accidentally tagging production instances (use tag exclusions)\n",
    "- ❌ **No notifications** - Engineers surprised by shutdown (Slack warnings 15 minutes before)\n",
    "- ❌ **No override** - Engineers can't keep instances running when needed (allow `AutoShutdown=false` tag)\n",
    "- ❌ **Weekends only** - Missing weeknight savings (shutdown 6pm-8am + weekends = 70% vs weekends-only = 29%)\n",

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Optimize Costs\n",
    "- **High cloud bills**: ML infrastructure >$10K/month (GPU instances, storage, egress)\n",
    "- **Idle resources**: GPUs/CPUs running 24/7 with <50% utilization\n",
    "- **Development waste**: Teams using production-size resources for dev/testing\n",
    "- **Scale-up pain**: Costs growing faster than revenue (need to control burn rate)\n",
    "- **Multi-cloud/multi-region**: Redundant deployments, data transfer fees accumulating\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Performance trade-offs**: Spot instances save 70% but can be preempted (need fault tolerance)\n",
    "- **Engineering overhead**: Cost optimization requires monitoring, automation, governance\n",
    "- **Tool costs**: Kubecost, CloudHealth add $500-2K/month (ROI must justify)\n",
    "- **False savings**: Over-optimizing can hurt reliability (cutting redundancy, backups)\n",
    "- **Measurement challenges**: Attributing costs to teams/projects requires tagging discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Fixed capacity**: Reserved instances (1-3 year commit) for 40-60% discount (less flexible)\n",
    "- **Managed services**: SageMaker, Vertex AI higher per-unit cost but lower ops overhead\n",
    "- **On-premise**: Own hardware for predictable workloads ($100K capex vs. $10K/month opex)\n",
    "- **Serverless**: Lambda, Cloud Run pay-per-inference (good for variable traffic, bad for steady high load)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Right-sizing**: Match instance types to workload (don't use p3.8xlarge for CPU-bound inference)\n",
    "- **Autoscaling**: HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) scales pods 10-100 based on load\n",
    "- **Spot/preemptible instances**: Use for training (fault-tolerant), not for serving (needs uptime)\n",
    "- **Storage tiering**: Hot (SSD) for active data, cold (S3 Glacier) for archives (10x cheaper)\n",
    "- **Data lifecycle**: Delete old experiment logs/checkpoints (70% of ML storage is waste)\n",
    "- **Cost allocation**: Tag all resources by team/project, chargeback to drive accountability"
