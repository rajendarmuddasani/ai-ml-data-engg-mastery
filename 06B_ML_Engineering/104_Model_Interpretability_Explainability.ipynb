    "# 104: Model Interpretability & Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** the difference between interpretability (global understanding) and explainability (local predictions)\n",
    "- **Implement** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for model-agnostic explanations\n",
    "- **Build** LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for individual prediction analysis\n",
    "- **Apply** interpretability techniques to semiconductor yield prediction models\n",
    "- **Evaluate** feature importance using multiple methods (permutation, tree-based, SHAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Model Interpretability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model interpretability is the ability to understand and explain how a machine learning model makes decisions. In regulated industries like semiconductor manufacturing, healthcare, and finance, interpretability isn't optional—it's mandatory. A black-box model that predicts 92% yield but can't explain why is often less valuable than a 88% accurate model that clearly identifies root causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretability** answers \"How does the model work globally?\" while **Explainability** answers \"Why did the model make this specific prediction?\" For example, knowing that voltage is the most important feature overall (interpretability) helps design better tests, while knowing that Device #47251 failed because its Vdd was 3.2σ above spec (explainability) enables targeted debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern interpretability techniques like SHAP and LIME work with any model—from simple linear regression to complex neural networks. They transform opaque algorithms into transparent decision systems that engineers can validate, debug, and trust in production environments where mistakes cost millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Model Interpretability?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: FDA, automotive (ISO 26262), and finance require explainable AI for safety-critical decisions\n",
    "- ✅ **Debug Model Failures**: Identify when models rely on spurious correlations or data leakage instead of real physics\n",
    "- ✅ **Build Trust**: Engineers accept ML predictions when they understand the reasoning (\"Yes, Vdd is too high\")\n",
    "- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: Discover which engineered features actually help vs add noise\n",
    "- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Pinpoint why specific devices fail (\"Lot C fails due to high temperature + low Vth combination\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 1: Yield Loss Root Cause Identification**\n",
    "- **Input**: Failed devices from wafer test with 150+ parametric measurements\n",
    "- **Model Output**: Binary classification (pass/fail) with 94% accuracy\n",
    "- **Explainability**: SHAP values identify top 3 contributing parameters per failed die\n",
    "- **Value**: Reduces root cause analysis time from 2 weeks to 2 days, $500K-$2M savings per yield excursion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 2: Outlier Device Investigation**\n",
    "- **Input**: Device #X has abnormal power consumption (2.5σ above mean)\n",
    "- **Model Output**: Power prediction model with 95% R²\n",
    "- **Explainability**: LIME shows Idd (leakage current) contributed +18mW, Freq contributed +7mW\n",
    "- **Value**: Identifies design vs manufacturing issues, prevents false RMAs, saves $50K per misdiagnosed unit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 3: Test Program Optimization Justification**\n",
    "- **Input**: Random Forest model predicting bin outcome from 500 parametric tests\n",
    "- **Model Output**: 97% bin prediction accuracy\n",
    "- **Explainability**: Permutation importance shows 200 tests have zero impact on predictions\n",
    "- **Value**: Safely remove redundant tests, reduce test time 35%, $3M-$7M annual ATE savings with proof\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 4: Adaptive Test Insertion Confidence**\n",
    "- **Input**: Real-time wafer test results, model predicts next test's outcome\n",
    "- **Model Output**: Probabilistic prediction (85% likely to pass AC parametric tests)\n",
    "- **Explainability**: SHAP force plot shows DC tests already indicate marginal performance\n",
    "- **Value**: Insert additional tests only for high-risk devices, balance coverage vs cost with engineering confidence\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Each Method:**\n",
    "- **Tree-based importance**: Quick baseline for tree models (RF, XGBoost), but biased\n",
    "- **Permutation importance**: Model-agnostic, unbiased, works for any model\n",
    "- **SHAP values**: Gold standard—both global and local explanations, theoretically sound\n",
    "- **LIME**: When you need simple linear approximations, fast for single predictions\n",
    "- **PDPs**: Understanding non-linear feature effects, but averages over interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Correlated features**: All methods struggle when features are highly correlated (multicollinearity)\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Computational cost**: SHAP can be slow for large datasets (use TreeExplainer or sampling)\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Interpretation != Causation**: High importance doesn't mean causal relationship\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Adversarial explanations**: Models can be trained to give misleading explanations\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Human bias**: Engineers may cherry-pick explanations that confirm existing beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. **Use multiple methods**: If SHAP, permutation, and tree importance agree → high confidence\n",
    "2. **Validate with domain experts**: Do top features match physics/engineering knowledge?\n",
    "3. **Check for data leakage**: If importance seems too good, investigate feature-target leakage\n",
    "4. **Sample for speed**: SHAP on 500-1000 samples usually sufficient for global patterns\n",
    "5. **Document explanations**: Include SHAP plots in model cards for production transparency\n",
    "6. **Monitor in production**: Feature importance can shift with data drift—re-compute monthly\n",
    "7. **Use explanations for debugging**: If model fails, SHAP shows which features caused error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Checklist:**\n",
    "- [ ] Compute SHAP values on validation set\n",
    "- [ ] Verify top 5 features make engineering sense\n",
    "- [ ] Create SHAP summary plot for model card\n",
    "- [ ] Build API endpoint for single-prediction explanations\n",
    "- [ ] Set up monitoring for feature importance drift\n",
    "- [ ] Train stakeholders on reading SHAP plots\n",
    "- [ ] Document known limitations and failure modes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Study **105: AutoML & NAS** for automated model search with interpretability constraints\n",
    "- Explore **107: Model Monitoring** to detect when feature importance changes in production\n",
    "- Apply to **Deep Learning (054)** with attention mechanisms and gradient-based explanations\n",
    "- Read \"Interpretable Machine Learning\" by Christoph Molnar (free online book)\n",
    "- Experiment with SHAP's advanced plots: dependence plots, interaction plots, waterfall plots"
