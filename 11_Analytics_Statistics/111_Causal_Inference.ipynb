    "# 111: Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** the fundamental difference between correlation and causation\n",
    "- **Implement** propensity score matching to eliminate confounding bias\n",
    "- **Apply** difference-in-differences (DiD) for quasi-experimental analysis\n",
    "- **Use** instrumental variables for endogeneity problems\n",
    "- **Build** regression discontinuity designs for treatment effect estimation\n",
    "- **Design** causal inference frameworks for post-silicon optimization and business decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Causal Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal inference** is the process of determining whether a relationship between variables is causal (X causes Y) rather than merely correlational. It answers \"what if\" questions: What would happen if we changed X? Would Y change as a result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike prediction (forecasting Y from X), causal inference focuses on **intervention effects**: What happens when we actively manipulate X? This is critical for decision-making because correlation does not imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Causal Inference?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Actionable Insights**: Identify which actions actually drive outcomes\n",
    "- ✅ **Policy Evaluation**: Measure true impact of interventions (not coincidental changes)\n",
    "- ✅ **Resource Allocation**: Invest in changes that cause improvements, not just correlate with them\n",
    "- ✅ **Avoid Spurious Relationships**: Don't act on misleading correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Flow Optimization Impact**\n",
    "- Question: Does reordering test blocks *cause* faster test times, or is it just newer devices?\n",
    "- Output: Causal effect = -0.3s test time (not due to tester upgrades or process drift)\n",
    "- Value: Confident investment in test flow changes knowing they actually work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Burn-In Effectiveness**\n",
    "- Question: Does burn-in *cause* lower field failures, or do we just ship better devices?\n",
    "- Output: Instrumental variable analysis shows 15% failure reduction attributable to burn-in\n",
    "- Value: Justify burn-in costs with causal evidence (not just correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Node Migration**\n",
    "- Question: Did moving to 7nm *cause* yield improvements, or was it better equipment?\n",
    "- Output: Difference-in-differences isolates 8% yield gain due to node shrink alone\n",
    "- Value: Inform future node migration ROI calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric Test Limit Changes**\n",
    "- Question: Do tighter Vdd limits *cause* better reliability, or healthier devices coincidentally pass?\n",
    "- Output: Regression discontinuity shows 2% reliability improvement at threshold\n",
    "- Value: Set limits based on causal impact, not spurious correlation\n",

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Causal Inference?\n",
    "Statistical methods to establish cause-and-effect relationships (X causes Y) rather than mere associations (X correlates with Y). Essential for making decisions based on interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Causal Inference Matters\n",
    "- **Predictions ≠ Actions**: Forecasting models predict Y from X, but don't tell you what happens if you *change* X\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation**: Invest in interventions that actually cause improvements, not spurious correlations\n",
    "- **Policy Evaluation**: Measure true impact of changes (new processes, treatments, campaigns)\n",
    "- **Scientific Rigor**: Distinguish causation from coincidence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Causal Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Example** |\n",
    "|------------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Confounding** | Variable Z causes both X and Y → spurious correlation | Process quality causes both frequency and yield |\n",
    "| **Treatment Effect** | Causal impact of X on Y: E[Y\\|X=1] - E[Y\\|X=0] | Burn-in reduces failures by 10% |\n",
    "| **Counterfactual** | What Y would have been without treatment | Same device without burn-in (unobservable!) |\n",
    "| **Selection Bias** | Treatment assignment not random → groups differ | Worse devices get burn-in → biased comparison |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causal Inference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propensity Score Matching (PSM):**\n",
    "- **When**: Observational data, treatment not randomized\n",
    "- **How**: Match treated/control units with similar propensity to be treated\n",
    "- **Assumption**: All confounders observed (\"unconfoundedness\")\n",
    "- **Strength**: Balances confounders, mimics randomization\n",
    "- **Weakness**: Cannot control for unobserved confounders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference-in-Differences (DiD):**\n",
    "- **When**: Treatment introduced over time, panel data available\n",
    "- **How**: (After - Before)_treatment - (After - Before)_control\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Parallel trends (both groups would follow same trend without treatment)\n",
    "- **Strength**: Controls for time-invariant confounders\n",
    "- **Weakness**: Sensitive to violations of parallel trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instrumental Variables (IV):**\n",
    "- **When**: Endogeneity (X and error term correlated)\n",
    "- **How**: Use instrument Z that affects Y only through X\n",
    "- **Assumption**: Exclusion restriction (Z → X → Y, no direct Z → Y)\n",
    "- **Strength**: Handles unobserved confounders\n",
    "- **Weakness**: Hard to find valid instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Discontinuity (RDD):**\n",
    "- **When**: Treatment assigned based on cutoff (e.g., score > 50)\n",
    "- **How**: Compare units just above vs just below cutoff\n",
    "- **Assumption**: No manipulation of running variable near cutoff\n",
    "- **Strength**: Very credible (quasi-randomization at threshold)\n",
    "- **Weakness**: Only local effect (at cutoff), not generalizable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Selection Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Can you randomize treatment?\n",

    "- ❌ **Weak Instruments**: IV estimates unreliable if instrument weakly predicts treatment\n",
    "- ❌ **Threshold Manipulation**: RDD fails if units game the cutoff\n",
    "- ❌ **Post-Treatment Bias**: Don't control for variables affected by treatment!\n",

    "### Post-Silicon Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Burn-In Effectiveness:**\n",

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Causal Inference\n",
    "- **Policy evaluation**: Measure causal effect of interventions (did process change improve yield?)\n",
    "- **A/B testing limitations**: Can't randomize treatment (can't randomly assign wafers to different fabs)\n",
    "- **Confounding present**: Observed correlation ≠ causation (temperature correlates with yield, but is it causal?)\n",
    "- **Counterfactual questions**: \"What would have happened without intervention?\" (yield if we hadn't changed supplier)\n",
    "- **Decision-making**: Need causal evidence, not just predictive accuracy (action requires causality understanding)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Unmeasured confounders**: Unknown variables bias causal estimates (hidden systematic differences)\n",
    "- **Positivity violations**: Treatment rarely assigned to some subgroups (no overlap = can't estimate ATE)\n",
    "- **Model misspecification**: Wrong functional form for propensity/outcome models → biased estimates\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Causal inference requires larger N than prediction (10,000+ for reliable ATE estimates)\n",
    "- **Temporal assumptions**: Treatment assignment must precede outcome (careful with time-series data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**: Gold standard but expensive/impractical (randomly assign fabs/processes)\n",
    "- **Difference-in-Differences**: Panel data method for policy evaluation (before/after + treatment/control)\n",
    "- **Regression Discontinuity**: Exploit cutoff rules for quasi-experiments (yield >80% gets premium pricing)\n",
    "- **Instrumental Variables**: Use external variation for causal identification (distance to supplier as IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Overlap diagnostics**: Check propensity score overlap between treated/control (trim extreme scores)\n",
    "- **Balance checking**: Verify covariates balanced after matching/weighting (standardized mean difference <0.1)\n",
    "- **Sensitivity analysis**: Test robustness to hidden confounding (Rosenbaum bounds, E-values)\n",
    "- **Multiple methods**: Compare estimates from matching, IPW, doubly-robust (DR-learner, AIPW)\n",
    "- **Domain knowledge**: Use expert input to identify confounders (can't be purely data-driven)\n",
    "- **Clear causal estimand**: Define WHAT causal effect you're estimating (ATE, ATT, CATE?)"
