    "- ✅ **Evaluation**: Test on 500+ holdout examples (never seen in training)\n",
    "- ✅ **Ablation**: Measure RAG-only, FT-only, Combined performance separately\n",
    "- ✅ **Hallucination Check**: Verify LLM doesn't fabricate facts (use RAG citations)\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost Monitoring**: Track inference costs (LoRA weights add <5% overhead)\n",
    "- ✅ **A/B Testing**: Deploy to 5% of users, compare to baseline RAG\n",
    "- ✅ **Version Control**: Track LoRA weights, training data, retrieval index together\n",
