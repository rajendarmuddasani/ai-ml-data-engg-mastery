    "2. **Quantized Fine-Tuning**: QLoRA (4-bit) reduces memory 4x, enables Llama-70B on single GPU\n",
    "3. **Retrieval-Aware Training**: Include \"Retrieved Context: ...\" in training examples\n",
    "4. **Multi-Task Fine-Tuning**: Train on summarization + Q&A + classification simultaneously\n",
    "5. **Knowledge Distillation**: Fine-tune smaller model (Llama-7B) from larger (GPT-4) responses\n",
