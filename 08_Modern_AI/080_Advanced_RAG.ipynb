    "\n",
    "**What is Multi-hop Reasoning?** Answering questions that require retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple documents across multiple retrieval steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-hop vs Multi-hop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Query Type | Hops | Example | Challenge |\n",
    "|------------|------|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Single-hop** | 1 | \"What is LPDDR5 VDD voltage?\" | One retrieval finds answer in spec sheet |\n",
    "| **Multi-hop** | 2+ | \"Compare Idd leakage across Gen1, Gen2, Gen3\" | Need 3 separate retrievals + synthesis |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Query Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"How did standby current improve from Gen1 to Gen3, and what design changes enabled it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Required hops:\n",
    "1. Retrieve Gen1 standby current spec (Idd = 200mA)\n",
    "2. Retrieve Gen2 standby current spec (Idd = 120mA)\n",
    "3. Retrieve Gen3 standby current spec (Idd = 50mA)\n",
    "4. Retrieve design change docs (clock gating, power domains)\n",
    "5. Synthesize: \"75% reduction (200mA→50mA) via improved clock gating + multi-domain power management\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-hop Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Iterative Retrieval (Chain-of-Thought)**\n",
    "```mermaid\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Graph-based Reasoning**\n",
    "- Build document graph (doc → related docs via citations/references)\n",
    "- Traverse graph from initial retrieval to connected documents\n",
    "- Use for: Research papers, technical manuals with cross-references\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LLM-guided Retrieval**\n",
    "- LLM generates next query based on previous retrieval\n",
    "- Adaptive: \"I found Gen1 spec, now I need Gen2...\"\n",
    "- Use for: Exploratory questions with unclear information needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-silicon use case:**\n",
    "- Query: \"Why did yield drop 15% between Q3 and Q4, and which test parameters correlate?\"\n",
    "- Hop 1: Retrieve Q3 and Q4 yield reports\n",
    "- Hop 2: Identify 15% drop (92% → 77%)\n",
    "- Hop 3: Retrieve parametric test data for both quarters\n",
    "- Hop 4: Find correlations (VDD_min failures increased 300%)\n",
    "- Hop 5: Retrieve voltage regulator qualification docs\n",
    "- Synthesis: \"Yield drop caused by new voltage regulator supplier with insufficient margining\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROI:** Multi-hop RAG answers 85% of complex questions automatically (vs 20% with single-hop), saving 120 hours/month of senior engineer investigation time = $240K/year."

    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Code? (Multi-hop RAG System)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement iterative multi-hop retrieval that decomposes complex queries and synthesizes information from multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Query decomposition**: LLM breaks complex question into atomic sub-queries\n",
    "- **Iterative retrieval**: Each sub-query retrieves relevant documents independently\n",
    "- **Context aggregation**: Combine retrieved contexts from all hops\n",
    "- **Synthesis**: LLM generates final answer using all gathered information\n",
    "- **Citation tracking**: Maintains source attribution across multiple hops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why iterative approach?** Each sub-query is simpler and more specific than the original complex query, leading to higher retrieval precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production optimization:** Cache intermediate results (if sub-query repeats across user sessions, reuse retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-silicon insight:** Multi-hop handles 85% of \"compare X vs Y\" and \"why did Z change\" questions that previously required manual analysis."

    "**1. Caching for Speed**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Cache expensive operations\n",
    "@lru_cache(maxsize=10000)\n",
    "def get_embedding(text):\n",
    "    return model.encode(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semantic caching (fuzzy match)\n",
    "def semantic_cache_lookup(query, cache, threshold=0.95):\n",
    "    for cached_query, cached_result in cache.items():\n",
    "        if cosine_sim(query, cached_query) > threshold:\n",
    "            return cached_result  # 50% cache hit rate in production\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Async Parallel Retrieval**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def parallel_hybrid_search(query):\n",
    "    # Run dense and sparse retrieval in parallel\n",
    "    dense_task = asyncio.create_task(dense_search(query))\n",
    "    sparse_task = asyncio.create_task(bm25_search(query))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    dense_results, sparse_results = await asyncio.gather(dense_task, sparse_task)\n",
    "    return fuse_results(dense_results, sparse_results)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduces latency: 800ms + 600ms = 1400ms sequential → 800ms parallel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Tiered Re-ranking**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Stage 1: Fast retrieval (top-50 in 0.5s)\n",
    "candidates = hybrid_search(query, k=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stage 2: Light re-ranking (top-20 in 0.3s)\n",
    "candidates = rerank_with_small_model(candidates, k=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stage 3: Heavy re-ranking (top-5 in 0.5s)\n",
    "final_results = rerank_with_cross_encoder(candidates, k=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Total: 1.3s vs 2.5s with single-stage cross-encoder on 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Query-Dependent Routing**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def route_query(query):\n",
    "    if is_simple_lookup(query):  # \"What is X?\"\n",
    "        return basic_rag(query)\n",
    "    elif is_comparison(query):   # \"Compare X vs Y\"\n",
    "        return multi_hop_rag(query)\n",
    "    elif has_abbreviations(query):  # \"PVT failures\"\n",
    "        return expanded_rag(query)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return hybrid_rag(query)  # Default\n",
    "\n",
    "# Saves compute by matching technique to query complexity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring & Alerting\n",
