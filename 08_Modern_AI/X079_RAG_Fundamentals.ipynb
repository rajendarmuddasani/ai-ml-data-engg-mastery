    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful architecture that combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models. RAG is particularly useful for tasks that require precise information retrieval followed by generative responses, such as technical documentation search, failure analysis, and test parameter recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "The RAG architecture involves several key components:\n",
    "- **Document Chunking**: Breaking down documents into manageable pieces.\n",
    "- **Embedding Generation**: Creating vector representations of chunks.\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Using vector embeddings to find relevant information.\n",
    "- **Generative Response**: Using a language model to generate responses based on retrieved information.\n",
