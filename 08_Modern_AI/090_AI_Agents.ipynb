    "## 📚 What are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Agents** are autonomous systems that use LLMs to plan, execute, and adapt using tools (RAG, calculators, APIs, databases). Unlike simple RAG (one query → one answer), agents break down complex tasks into steps and execute them autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "1. **Planning**: Break complex task into subtasks (ReAct reasoning)\n",
    "2. **Tool Use**: Call functions (RAG search, run code, query DB)\n",
    "3. **Memory**: Remember context across multiple interactions\n",
    "4. **Adaptation**: Adjust plan based on results\n",
    "5. **Multi-Agent**: Multiple specialized agents collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why AI Agents?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Complex Tasks**: Intel debug agent handles multi-step analysis ($22M savings)\n",
    "- ✅ **Automation**: NVIDIA design agent automates workflows ($18M savings)\n",
    "- ✅ **Collaboration**: Multi-agent customer support (resolve 85% of tickets, $30M savings)\n",
    "- ✅ **Autonomy**: Research agents run experiments without human intervention ($15M value)\n",

    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Intel Multi-Agent Debug System ($22M Annual Savings)**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Debug failures require planning + data analysis + root cause + validation\n",
    "- **Solution**: Planning agent + RAG agent + execution agent + validation agent\n",
    "- **Impact**: Autonomous debug (5 days → 1 day), 95% success rate, $22M savings\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. NVIDIA Design Optimization Agent ($18M Annual Savings)**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Power optimization requires design search + simulation + validation\n",
    "- **Solution**: Agent explores design space (run 1000 simulations autonomously)\n",
    "- **Impact**: Find optimal design 10× faster, $18M power savings\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. AMD Test Planning Agent ($15M Annual Savings)**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Create test plan from spec (identify tests + dependencies + schedule)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Agent reads spec → identifies tests → checks coverage → generates plan\n",
    "- **Impact**: Test planning 8× faster (2 weeks → 2 days), $15M savings\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Qualcomm Compliance Agent ($12M Annual Savings)**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Check design against 5000 FCC/3GPP regulations\n",
    "- **Solution**: Agent reads design → retrieves regulations → checks compliance → reports\n",

    "## Part 1: ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** = **Rea**soning + **Act**ing (alternating thought and action)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Thought**: Reason about what to do next\n",
    "2. **Action**: Execute a tool (RAG, calculator, API)\n",
    "3. **Observation**: See tool result\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until task complete\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Intel Debug Task**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Debug why wafer W2024-1234 has 30% yield loss\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought 1: I need to find similar failure patterns\n",
    "Action 1: RAG_search(\"wafer yield loss 30 percent similar cases\")\n",
    "Observation 1: Found 5 similar cases: W2024-0567, W2024-0892, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought 2: Check if parametric data shows correlation\n",
    "Action 2: query_database(\"SELECT * FROM parametric_tests WHERE wafer_id='W2024-1234'\")\n",
    "Observation 2: Vdd shows 10% variation across die\n",

    "Thought 3: Compare with passing wafers\n",
    "Action 3: query_database(\"SELECT AVG(vdd_variance) FROM wafers WHERE yield > 95%\")\n",
    "Observation 3: Passing wafers have <2% Vdd variation\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought 4: Check if similar cases had power supply issue\n",
    "Action 4: RAG_search(\"Vdd variation 10 percent root cause\")\n",
    "Observation 4: 4 out of 5 similar cases: power supply regulator fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought 5: I have enough evidence\n",
    "Final Answer: Root cause likely power supply regulator fault. \n",
    "Recommendation: Check power delivery network, replace regulator, retest.\n",

    "### **Agent Architecture Patterns**\n",
    "1. **ReAct**: Reasoning + Acting (alternating thought/action)\n",
    "2. **AutoGPT**: Autonomous goal decomposition\n",
    "3. **BabyAGI**: Task prioritization + execution\n",
    "4. **LangChain Agents**: Tool-augmented LLMs\n",
    "5. **Multi-Agent**: Specialized agents collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tool Design Principles**\n",
    "- **Clear Description**: Tool description guides LLM when to use\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Validate input/output types\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Return helpful error messages\n",
    "- **Idempotency**: Same input → same output\n",
    "- **Logging**: Track all tool calls for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Memory Strategies**\n",
    "- **Short-term**: Recent conversation history (last 10 turns)\n",
    "- **Long-term**: Vector DB of past solutions (RAG-style)\n",
    "- **Working memory**: Current task context\n",
    "- **Episodic**: Remember successful strategies\n",
    "- **Procedural**: Learn from repeated tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Production Checklist**\n",
    "- ✅ Define tools with clear descriptions\n",
    "- ✅ Implement ReAct reasoning loop\n",
    "- ✅ Add memory (short-term + long-term)\n",
    "- ✅ Set max iterations (prevent infinite loops)\n",
    "- ✅ Log all actions (debugging + auditing)\n",
    "- ✅ Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions\n",
    "- ✅ Graceful failure handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Pitfalls**\n",
    "- **Infinite loops**: Agent gets stuck repeating actions\n",
    "- **Hallucinated tools**: Agent tries to use non-existent tools\n",
    "- **Missing memory**: Agent forgets earlier findings\n",
    "- **No validation**: Agent doesn't verify solutions\n",
    "- **Over-automation**: Tasks requiring human judgment\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Pro Tip**: Start with simple agents (1-2 tools, 5 iterations max), then expand capabilities based on success rate."
