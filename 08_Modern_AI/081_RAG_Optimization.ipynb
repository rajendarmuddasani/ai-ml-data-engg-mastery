    "**Pitfall 1: Over-optimizing too early**\n",
    "- 🚨 Problem: Added IVF-PQ for 10K documents → worse performance\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Start with Flat index, optimize when hitting limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 2: Cache stampede**\n",
    "- 🚨 Problem: Cache expires, 1000 simultaneous requests hit LLM\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Staggered TTL, request coalescing, background refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 3: GPU memory OOM**\n",
    "- 🚨 Problem: Batch size too large → CUDA out of memory\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Dynamic batching, monitor GPU memory, retry with smaller batch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 4: Index staleness**\n",
    "- 🚨 Problem: New documents added but index not rebuilt\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Incremental indexing (FAISS add_with_ids), nightly full rebuild\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 5: Cost runaway**\n",
    "- 🚨 Problem: GPU always on, LLM no caching → $15K/month\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Auto-scaling (scale to zero off-hours), aggressive caching\n",

    "### Common Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Should I start with GPU or CPU?**\n",
    "A: Start CPU if QPS <100. Switch to GPU when latency >500ms or QPS >1000. Break-even at ~1000 QPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the minimum cache hit rate to justify caching?**\n",
    "A: 30% hit rate breaks even on Redis costs. Target 60%+ for significant ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When to use IVF vs IVF-PQ?**\n",
    "A: IVF for 100K-1M docs (10× speedup, same memory). IVF-PQ for >1M docs (100× compression, 95% recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How to balance recall vs latency?**\n",
    "A: Tune `nprobe` parameter. Higher = better recall, slower search. nprobe=32 typically gives 95% recall at 10× speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Self-host embeddings or use OpenAI?**\n",
    "A: Self-host if >3M docs/month. Break-even: $360/month GPU = 3.6M docs × $0.0001.\n",
