## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Works:
✅ **3-4 bullet points** - perfect balance of detail vs brevity  
✅ **Mermaid diagrams** - no external tools needed  
✅ **Purpose-first explanations** - learners know "why" before "how"  
✅ **Dual context** - specialized + general = broader appeal  
✅ **Project naming** - "projects" > "exercises" (more professional)  

### Considerations:
⚠️ **Balance** - Don't overwhelm with too many diagrams  
⚠️ **Specificity** - Post-silicon examples need enough context  
⚠️ **Maintenance** - Instructions file must be followed consistently  
⚠️ **Numbering** - Be intentional about using categories in filenames
