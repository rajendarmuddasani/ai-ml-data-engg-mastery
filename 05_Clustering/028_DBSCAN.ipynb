    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand density-based clustering**: Core points, border points, noise, reachability concepts\n",
    "2. **Master DBSCAN parameters**: eps (neighborhood radius), min_samples (density threshold), distance metrics\n",
    "3. **Implement from scratch**: Build DBSCAN algorithm with region queries and cluster expansion\n",
    "4. **Handle arbitrary shapes**: Cluster non-spherical data that defeats K-Means and hierarchical methods\n",
    "5. **Detect outliers automatically**: Label noise points as -1 without forcing into clusters\n",
    "6. **Apply to real problems**: Geospatial defect clustering, anomaly detection, wafer map hotspots\n",

    "### 📝 What's Happening: Building DBSCAN from Ground Up\n",

    "**Purpose:** Implement DBSCAN from scratch to understand core/border/noise classification and cluster expansion logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Region Query**: Find all points within eps radius using distance matrix (naive O(n) per query)\n",
    "- **Core Point Detection**: Mark points with >= min_samples neighbors as core points\n",
    "- **Cluster Expansion**: Recursively add density-reachable points via BFS/DFS\n",
    "- **Border Assignment**: Non-core points in core neighborhoods become border points\n",
    "- **Noise Labeling**: Isolated points (not reachable from any core) labeled as -1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Understanding expansion logic reveals why DBSCAN discovers arbitrary shapes (follows density contours) vs K-Means (spherical boundaries). In wafer defect clustering, DBSCAN traces irregular hotspot patterns that K-Means would split incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Context:** For wafer map spatial defects, DBSCAN correctly identifies elongated scratch patterns or crescent-shaped edge failures that K-Means would fragment into multiple circular clusters. From-scratch implementation clarifies why eps must match physical die spacing (typically 5-10mm)."

    "## 🏭 Real-World Application: Wafer Map Spatial Defect Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Silicon Validation Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:** Semiconductor wafer testing produces spatial defect maps showing failed die locations. Engineers need to:\n",
    "1. Distinguish systematic defects (clusters, patterns) from random failures (noise)\n",
    "2. Identify hotspot locations for root cause investigation (process tool, contamination)\n",
    "3. Quantify defect cluster characteristics (size, density, shape) for yield impact analysis\n",
    "4. Prioritize failure analysis efforts on clustered (systematic) vs isolated (random) failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**DBSCAN Solution:** Cluster defect die locations `(die_x, die_y)` to automatically identify hotspots while labeling random failures as noise (-1). No need to specify number of defect patterns upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What's Happening: Wafer Defect Pattern Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Apply DBSCAN to realistic wafer defect map (300 die, multiple defect patterns + random failures) to separate systematic from random failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Defect Patterns**: Simulate 3 systematic defect clusters (scratch, hotspot, edge cluster) + 10% random failures\n",
    "- **Spatial Coordinates**: Die (x, y) positions on 300mm wafer\n",
    "- **Automatic Discovery**: DBSCAN finds 3 clusters without specifying K upfront\n",
    "- **Noise Labeling**: Random failures automatically labeled as -1 (not forced into clusters like K-Means)\n",
    "- **Business Value**: Systematic defects (clusters) get priority FA investigation ($50K-200K per analysis), random failures (noise) deprioritized\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Manual defect classification takes 30-60 minutes per wafer map; DBSCAN provides instant systematic vs random separation. For 1000 wafers/day fabs, automated clustering saves 500+ engineering hours/day and catches systematic excursions hours faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Context:** Real wafer defect patterns include:\n",
    "- **Scratch clusters**: Linear arrangements (equipment damage)\n",
    "- **Hotspots**: Circular high-density regions (contamination particles)\n",
    "- **Edge clusters**: Crescent-shaped edge exclusions (process uniformity)\n",
    "- **Random failures**: Scattered isolated die (intrinsic yield loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN correctly identifies all pattern types while K-Means would force random failures into nearest cluster, creating false systematic classifications."

    "\n",
    "### ✅ When to Use DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arbitrary cluster shapes**: Non-spherical, non-convex patterns (K-Means fails)\n",
    "2. **Unknown K**: Don't know cluster count → DBSCAN discovers automatically\n",
    "3. **Outliers critical**: Need explicit noise detection (label=-1)\n",
    "4. **Geospatial data**: GPS coordinates, wafer maps, sensor networks\n",
    "5. **Varying densities tolerable**: As long as single eps works across data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon:** Wafer defect clustering, spatial failure analysis, anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ When NOT to Use DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Varying densities**: Dense + sparse clusters → single eps fails (use HDBSCAN)\n",
    "2. **High dimensions (>20)**: Curse of dimensionality (distances become uniform)\n",
    "3. **Large data + no spatial index**: >100K points naive = too slow\n",
    "4. **Well-separated spherical clusters**: K-Means faster and simpler\n",
    "5. **Incremental clustering**: DBSCAN requires full recomputation for new points\n",
