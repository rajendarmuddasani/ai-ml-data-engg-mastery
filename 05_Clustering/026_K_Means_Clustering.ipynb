    "1. Choose first centroid $\\mu_1$ uniformly at random\n",

    "   - Compute distance $D(x_i)$ = min distance from $x_i$ to existing centroids\n",
    "   - Choose next centroid with probability $\\propto D(x_i)^2$ (far from existing)\n",
    "3. Proceed with standard K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: Initial centroids are spread out → faster convergence, better results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Multiple Runs (n_init)\n",
    "- Run K-Means multiple times (sklearn default: 10) with different initializations\n",
    "- Keep best result (lowest inertia)\n",
    "- **Tradeoff**: 10x slower training, but more stable results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Distance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Euclidean Distance** (default):\n",
    "$$d(x_i, \\mu_k) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^d (x_{ij} - \\mu_{kj})^2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Convergence Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Means converges when**:\n",
    "1. Centroids stop changing: $||\\mu_k^{(t+1)} - \\mu_k^{(t)}|| < \\epsilon$ for all $k$\n",
    "2. Cluster assignments stop changing\n",
    "3. Maximum iterations reached (prevent infinite loops)\n",

    "**Guaranteed to converge**: Yes (monotonic decrease in $J$), but may reach local minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Optimal K Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Elbow Method (Visual)\n",

    "4. **Example**: Sharp decrease 1→3, gradual after 3 → optimal K ≈ 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula** (inertia):\n",
    "$$\\text{Inertia} = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} ||x_i - \\mu_k||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Silhouette Score (Quantitative)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures how similar a point is to its cluster vs other clusters (-1 to 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max(a(i), b(i))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $a(i)$ = mean intra-cluster distance (distance to points in same cluster)\n",
    "- $b(i)$ = mean nearest-cluster distance (distance to points in nearest other cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- $s(i) \\approx 1$: Point well-matched to own cluster\n",
    "- $s(i) \\approx 0$: Point on border between clusters\n",
    "- $s(i) \\approx -1$: Point likely in wrong cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**: Run for K = 2, 3, ..., max_K, choose K with highest average silhouette score\n",

    "**Purpose:** Find optimal K by identifying where adding more clusters yields diminishing inertia reduction.\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ When to Use K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large datasets (10K+ points)**: K-Means scales efficiently O(nkt) vs hierarchical O(n²)\n",
    "2. **Spherical clusters**: Data naturally forms round, compact groups (not elongated or irregular shapes)\n",
    "3. **Known K or business constraint**: Domain knowledge suggests cluster count (e.g., 4 wafer zones, 5 customer segments)\n",
    "4. **Speed critical**: Real-time clustering (1M points in <10 seconds) for production systems\n",
    "5. **Interpretable centroids**: Centroid coordinates provide clear cluster \"prototypes\" (e.g., \"high-Idd edge die\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- ✅ Customer segmentation (RFM scores → 5 tiers)\n",
    "- ✅ Image compression (RGB pixels → K dominant colors)\n",
    "- ✅ Wafer spatial patterns (die coordinates → 4-6 zones)\n",
    "- ✅ Market regime detection (volatility/trend → 4 regimes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ When NOT to Use K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-spherical clusters**: Elongated, crescent, or irregular shapes → Use DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models\n",
    "2. **Unknown K with high uncertainty**: No domain hints, wide elbow curve → Use hierarchical clustering (dendrogram)\n",
    "3. **Varying cluster densities**: Some clusters tight, others loose → Use DBSCAN (density-based)\n",
    "4. **Outliers dominate**: Many noise points far from clusters → Use DBSCAN (labels outliers as -1)\n",
    "5. **High-dimensional data (100+ features)**: Curse of dimensionality → Apply PCA first or use spectral clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- ❌ Anomaly detection (use Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor)\n",
    "- ❌ Hierarchical taxonomy discovery (use Hierarchical Clustering)\n",
    "- ❌ Text document clustering without dimensionality reduction (use LDA or NMF)\n",
    "- ❌ Geospatial clusters with noise (use DBSCAN with eps tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 K-Means vs Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Criterion** | **K-Means** | **Hierarchical** | **DBSCAN** | **Gaussian Mixture** |\n",
    "|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Cluster shape** | Spherical | Any (dendrogram) | Arbitrary | Elliptical |\n",
    "| **Requires K upfront** | Yes | No (cut dendrogram) | No (density-based) | Yes |\n",
    "| **Outlier handling** | Poor (assigns to nearest) | Poor | Excellent (noise=-1) | Good (soft assignment) |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Excellent (O(nkt)) | Poor (O(n²)) | Medium (O(n log n)) | Medium (EM iterations) |\n",
    "| **Interpretability** | Excellent (centroids) | Medium (dendrogram) | Low (density threshold) | Medium (Gaussian params) |\n",
    "| **Use case** | Customer segmentation | Taxonomy, small data | Geospatial, outliers | Image segmentation, soft clustering |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Implementation Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Scaling is Mandatory**: K-Means uses Euclidean distance → unscaled features (e.g., Idd in mA, freq in MHz) dominate\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "   X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **K-Means++ Initialization**: sklearn default, reduces sensitivity to random starts (10-50× faster convergence)\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', n_init=10)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Random Starts**: Run K-Means 10-20 times with different initializations, keep best (lowest inertia)\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, n_init=20)  # sklearn tries 20 random starts\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Elbow + Silhouette Consensus**: Use both methods to validate optimal K\n",
    "   - Elbow: Sharp bend indicates diminishing returns\n",
    "   - Silhouette: Higher score (0.5-0.7) indicates well-separated clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **MiniBatchKMeans for Large Data**: Memory-efficient variant for 500K+ points\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans\n",
    "   kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=k, batch_size=1000, random_state=42)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dimensionality Reduction Pre-Processing**: For 50+ features, apply PCA to reduce to 10-20 dimensions\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n",
    "   pca = PCA(n_components=15)\n",
    "   X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)\n",
    "   kmeans.fit(X_reduced)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Post-Clustering Validation**: Always inspect cluster sizes, centroids, and sample points per cluster\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(np.bincount(kmeans.labels_))  # Cluster sizes\n",
    "   print(kmeans.cluster_centers_)      # Centroid coordinates\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ignoring Feature Scaling**: Leads to features with large ranges (e.g., freq_MHz=2000) dominating distance calculations\n",
    "2. **Choosing K by Eyeballing**: Always use quantitative methods (Elbow, Silhouette, BIC) + domain knowledge\n",
    "3. **Empty Clusters**: Can occur with poor initialization → use K-Means++ or increase n_init\n",
    "4. **Assuming Euclidean Distance**: K-Means assumes spherical clusters; consider Manhattan distance for sparse data\n",
    "5. **Not Validating Cluster Quality**: Low silhouette (<0.3) indicates poor clustering → reconsider K or use different algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Interpretation** | **Ideal Value** |\n",
    "|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Inertia (WCSS)** | $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\min_k \\|\\| x_i - \\mu_k \\|\\|^2$ | Within-cluster variance | Lower better (but diminishes with K) |\n",
    "| **Silhouette Score** | $\\frac{b - a}{\\max(a, b)}$ (cohesion vs separation) | Cluster quality | 0.5-0.7 good, >0.7 excellent |\n",
    "| **Davies-Bouldin Index** | Avg ratio of within-cluster to between-cluster distances | Cluster separation | Lower better (<1.0 good) |\n",
    "| **Calinski-Harabasz** | Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance | Cluster definition | Higher better (100+ good) |\n",
