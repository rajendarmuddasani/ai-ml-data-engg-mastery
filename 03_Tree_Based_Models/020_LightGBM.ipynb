    "**Traditional GBM split finding** (O(#data \u00d7 #features)):\n",
    "- For each feature, sort all values\n",
    "- Try every possible split point\n",
    "- Compute gain for each split\n",
    "\n",
    "**LightGBM histogram approach** (O(#bins \u00d7 #features)):\n",
    "1. **Discretize features** into fixed number of bins (default 255):  \n",
    "   $$x_{binned} = \\text{bin}(x, \\text{thresholds})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build gradient/hessian histograms** for each bin:  \n",
    "   $$H_k = \\sum_{x_i \\in \\text{bin}_k} (g_i, h_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find best split** by scanning bins (not individual values):  \n",
    "   $$\\text{Gain} = \\max_{k} \\left[ \\frac{(\\sum_{j \\leq k} g_j)^2}{\\sum_{j \\leq k} h_j + \\lambda} + \\frac{(\\sum_{j > k} g_j)^2}{\\sum_{j > k} h_j + \\lambda} \\right]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Leaf-Wise vs Level-Wise Tree Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level-wise (XGBoost, traditional GBM):**\n",
    "- Split all nodes at current level before going deeper\n",
    "- Balanced tree (same depth on all branches)\n",
    "- Conservative, less prone to overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leaf-wise (LightGBM):**\n",
    "- Split the leaf with maximum gain (regardless of level)\n",
    "- Unbalanced tree (deeper where data is complex)\n",
    "- More aggressive, achieves lower loss with fewer leaves\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula for leaf selection:**\n",
    "$$\\text{Best leaf} = \\arg\\max_{\\text{leaf}} \\Delta \\mathcal{L}(\\text{leaf})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Delta \\mathcal{L}$ is loss reduction from splitting that leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off:** Leaf-wise faster convergence but higher overfitting risk \u2192 use `max_depth` carefully (default 31, use 10-15 in practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GOSS (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Computing histograms for all N samples is still expensive for massive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Sample intelligently based on gradient magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Sort samples by absolute gradient $|g_i|$ (descending)\n",
    "2. Keep top $a \\times N$ samples (large gradients, important instances)\n",
    "3. Randomly sample $b \\times N$ from remaining (small gradients)\n",
    "4. Amplify small-gradient samples by factor $(1-a)/b$ to maintain correct distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Use only $(a + b) \\times N$ samples (e.g., 30% of data) with minimal accuracy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### EFB (Exclusive Feature Bundling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** High-dimensional sparse data (e.g., one-hot encoded features) wastes memory and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:** Many features are mutually exclusive (never take non-zero values simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Bundle exclusive features into single feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- One-hot encoding: `country_USA`, `country_UK`, `country_Canada` \u2192 Bundle into single `country` feature\n",
    "- Sparse features: If feature A and B never both non-zero \u2192 bundle as `A_or_B`\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Always specify categorical features**\n",

    "   lgb.fit(X_train, y_train, categorical_feature=['col1', 'col2'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with defaults, tune if needed**\n",
    "   - `num_leaves=31`, `max_bin=255`, `learning_rate=0.1`\n",
    "   - Increase `num_leaves` for complex patterns (but risk overfitting)\n",
    "   - Decrease `learning_rate` + increase `n_estimators` for production\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use early stopping**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   callbacks=[lgb.early_stopping(stopping_rounds=20)]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitor validation metrics**\n",
    "   - Always use `eval_set` for train/validation curves\n",
    "   - Watch for overfitting (train-val gap)\n",
    "   - Use appropriate metric (AUC for imbalanced, RMSE for regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enable GPU for massive datasets**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   lgb.LGBMClassifier(device='gpu', gpu_platform_id=0, gpu_device_id=0)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use native API for maximum control**\n",
    "   - `lgb.Dataset` for memory efficiency\n",
    "   - `lgb.train()` for custom callbacks\n",
    "   - `lgb.cv()` for cross-validation\n",
