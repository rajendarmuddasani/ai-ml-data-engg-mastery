    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** mathematical optimization formulations for business processes\n",
    "- **Implement** linear programming for resource allocation and scheduling\n",
    "- **Build** mixed-integer programming solvers for discrete decisions\n",
    "- **Apply** network flow optimization for multi-site routing\n",
    "- **Develop** genetic algorithms for multi-objective process optimization\n",
    "- **Optimize** semiconductor manufacturing workflows with quantified business value\n",

    "## 📚 What is Business Process Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Process Optimization (BPO)** combines **process mining** (understanding current state) with **mathematical optimization** (finding best possible state). While process mining reveals bottlenecks and inefficiencies, optimization determines the best resource allocation, scheduling, and process configuration to maximize objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPO answers questions like:\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation**: How many machines/people should we assign to each activity?\n",
    "- **Scheduling**: In what order should we process cases to minimize cycle time?\n",
    "- **Process Design**: Which process variant minimizes cost while meeting quality constraints?\n",
    "- **Capacity Planning**: How much capacity do we need to meet demand with 95% service level?\n",

    "- ✅ **Handles discrete decisions**: Yes/no, assignment, ordering\n",

    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- ❌ **NP-hard**: Computational complexity grows exponentially\n",

    "\n",
    "**Algorithm: Branch-and-Bound:**\n",
    "1. Relax integer constraints → solve LP (lower bound)\n",
    "2. If solution is integer → done (optimal)\n",
    "3. Otherwise, branch on fractional variable (e.g., $x = 0.7$ → try $x = 0$ and $x = 1$)\n",
    "4. Recursively solve subproblems, prune if bound worse than incumbent\n",
    "5. Return best integer solution found\n",

    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Optimize when problem is non-linear, non-convex, or has multiple conflicting objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Algorithm (GA) Framework:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Population:} \\quad & P_t = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\} \\quad \\text{(Generation } t \\text{)} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Fitness:} \\quad & f(x_i) \\quad \\text{(Objective value)} \\\\\n",

    "\\text{Mutation:} \\quad & x'_{\\text{child}} = \\text{Mutate}(x_{\\text{child}}) \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Next gen:} \\quad & P_{t+1} = P'_t \\cup \\{\\text{children}\\}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Algorithm Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Random population of candidate solutions\n",
    "2. **Evaluate**: Calculate fitness for each individual\n",
    "3. **Select**: Choose parents (bias toward higher fitness)\n",
    "4. **Crossover**: Combine parent genes to create offspring\n",
    "5. **Mutate**: Randomly modify offspring (explore search space)\n",
    "6. **Replace**: Form next generation, repeat until convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Objective Optimization:**\n",
    "When objectives conflict (e.g., minimize cost AND maximize quality):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize:} \\quad \\vec{f}(x) = [f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_k(x)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pareto Optimality:**\n",
    "- Solution $x^*$ is Pareto optimal if no other solution is better in ALL objectives\n",
    "- **Pareto front**: Set of all Pareto optimal solutions\n",
    "- Trade-off: Improving one objective worsens another\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives (conflicting):**\n",
    "1. **Minimize downtime** (maximize production)\n",
    "2. **Minimize maintenance cost** (reduce expenses)\n",
    "3. **Maximize equipment reliability** (prevent failures)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "- $x_i$ = PM interval for equipment $i$ (days between maintenance)\n",
    "- $y_i$ = Spare parts inventory level for equipment $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- Minimum uptime: $\\geq 88\\%$ (industry standard)\n",
    "- Budget: Total cost $\\leq \\$5M/year$\n",
    "- Technician capacity: $\\leq 20$ PM events/week\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Handles non-linearity**: No assumptions about objective function shape\n",
    "- ✅ **Multi-objective**: Finds Pareto front (trade-off surface)\n",
    "- ✅ **Global search**: Less likely to get stuck in local optima\n",
    "- ✅ **No gradients needed**: Works with black-box functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- ❌ **No optimality guarantee**: Heuristic, may miss global optimum\n",
    "- ❌ **Slow convergence**: Needs many function evaluations\n",
    "- ❌ **Parameter tuning**: Population size, mutation rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:**\n",
    "- Optimize PM schedule for wafer fab equipment (100+ tools)\n",
    "- Example solution (from Pareto front):\n",
    "  - Option A: PM every 30 days, 95% uptime, $3.2M cost\n",
    "  - Option B: PM every 45 days, 91% uptime, $2.1M cost (chosen)\n",
    "  - Option C: PM every 60 days, 88% uptime, $1.8M cost\n",
    "- Business value: 30% downtime reduction (12% → 8.4%) = **$73.8M/year**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Pareto front reveals trade-offs (can't improve all objectives simultaneously)\n",
    "- Decision maker chooses point on front based on priorities\n",
    "- GA explores search space efficiently through evolution"

    "### 💡 Pro Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model incrementally** - Start simple (LP), add complexity only if needed (MILP, GA)\n",
    "2. **Validate rigorously** - Compare optimal to heuristic, test edge cases, verify constraints\n",
    "3. **Understand trade-offs** - No free lunch (fast vs optimal vs scalable)\n",
    "4. **Use commercial solvers** - Gurobi, CPLEX are 10-100x faster than open-source for MILP\n",
    "5. **Leverage structure** - Network flow, transportation problems have special algorithms\n",
    "6. **Parallelize** - GAs, scenario-based optimization highly parallelizable\n",
    "7. **Pre-solve** - Reduce problem size (fix variables, eliminate redundant constraints)\n",

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Business Process Optimization\n",
    "- **Repetitive processes**: Workflows executed 1000+ times/year (ATE test programs run millions of times)\n",
    "- **High-cost activities**: Processes with significant resource consumption (test time = $500-$2000/hr on ATE)\n",
    "- **Quality issues**: Processes with defect rates >5% (yield losses, rework loops)\n",
    "- **Compliance requirements**: Regulated processes needing auditable optimization (automotive IATF, aerospace AS9100)\n",
    "- **Cross-functional processes**: Workflows spanning multiple departments (design → test → manufacturing → quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Requires quantitative data**: Optimization needs metrics (cycle time, cost, quality) - subjective \"gut feel\" doesn't work\n",
    "- **Change management overhead**: Process changes require training, documentation updates, stakeholder buy-in\n",
    "- **Local vs. global optima**: Optimizing one subprocess may worsen overall system (test time reduction → higher yield loss)\n",
    "- **Dynamic environments**: Optimal process today may be suboptimal tomorrow (new products, technology changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Lean Six Sigma**: DMAIC methodology for process improvement (more manual, less data-driven)\n",
    "- **Theory of Constraints (TOC)**: Focus on system bottleneck (simpler but ignores non-bottleneck improvements)\n",
    "- **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**: Radical redesign (higher risk, higher potential reward)\n",
    "- **Manual time-motion studies**: Stopwatch + clipboard (simple but doesn't scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Define clear objectives**: Minimize cycle time? Cost? Defects? Multi-objective optimization requires trade-off analysis\n",
    "- **Baseline measurement**: Measure current state before changes (can't improve what you don't measure)\n",
    "- **Constraint identification**: Use process mining to find bottlenecks (optimize bottleneck first = biggest ROI)\n",
    "- **Sensitivity analysis**: Test optimization robustness to parameter changes (what if test volume increases 2x?)\n",
    "- **Pilot testing**: Deploy optimized process on 10% of volume first, validate improvements before full rollout\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Track KPIs post-optimization (improvements decay over time without reinforcement)"
