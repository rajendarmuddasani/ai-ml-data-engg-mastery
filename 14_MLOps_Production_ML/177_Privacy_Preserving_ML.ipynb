    "\n",
    "**Definition:** An algorithm $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies **(\u03b5, \u03b4)-differential privacy** if for all neighboring datasets $D$ and $D'$ (differing by one record) and all possible outputs $S$:\n",

    "- **\u03b5 (epsilon):** Privacy loss parameter - smaller \u03b5 = stronger privacy\n",
    "  - \u03b5 = 0: Perfect privacy (completely random output)\n",
    "  - \u03b5 = 1: Strong privacy (typical target for sensitive data)\n",
    "  - \u03b5 = 3: Moderate privacy (acceptable for many applications)\n",

    "**Method:** Add Laplace noise calibrated to sensitivity:\n",

    "   $$g_i^{\\text{clip}} = g_i \\cdot \\min\\left(1, \\frac{C}{\\|g_i\\|}\\right)$$\n",

    "2. **Allocate per operation:**\n",
    "   - Data exploration: \u03b5=0.5 (10 queries at \u03b5=0.05 each)\n",
    "   - Model training: \u03b5=2.0 (DP-SGD with 100 epochs)\n",
    "   - Model evaluation: \u03b5=0.5 (5 queries at \u03b5=0.1 each)\n",
    "3. **Track composition:** Use privacy accountant libraries (TensorFlow Privacy, Opacus)\n",
    "4. **Stop when budget exhausted:** No more queries allowed \u2192 prevents privacy leak\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Example:**\n",
    "- Cross-fab yield modeling: \u03b5_total = 3.0 across 6 fabs\n",
    "- Each fab contributes \u03b5=0.5 per round (federated learning)\n",

    "**When to Use Privacy-Preserving ML:**\n",
    "- Sensitive personal data (healthcare records, financial transactions, biometrics)\n",
    "- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA compliance)\n",
    "- Multi-party collaboration without data sharing (federated learning across competitors)\n",
    "- Public datasets with privacy guarantees (census data, research datasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Accuracy-privacy trade-off (noise addition reduces model quality by 2-10%)\n",
    "- Computational overhead (homomorphic encryption 100-1000x slower)\n",
    "- Privacy budget management (\u03b5 depletes with queries, limits data reuse)\n",
    "- Complexity of implementation (differential privacy requires expertise)\n",
    "- May not prevent all privacy attacks (membership inference still possible with large \u03b5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives:**\n",
    "- **Data anonymization** (k-anonymity, l-diversity - weaker guarantees)\n",
    "- **Synthetic data generation** (GANs, variational autoencoders - distribution-preserving)\n",
    "- **Secure enclaves** (hardware-based isolation like Intel SGX)\n",
    "- **Access controls** (audit logs, role-based permissions - no mathematical guarantee)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Set privacy budget carefully (\u03b5=1-10 for strong privacy, \u03b5>10 weak)\n",
    "- Use composition theorems (track total privacy loss across queries)\n",
    "- Apply privacy amplification (subsampling reduces privacy cost)\n",
    "- Clip gradients before adding noise (prevent outlier influence)\n",
    "- Use advanced accountants (Renyi DP for tighter bounds than basic composition)\n",
    "- Test privacy guarantees empirically (membership inference attacks as validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- 172: Federated Learning (combine with differential privacy)\n",
    "- 178: AI Safety & Alignment (privacy as safety requirement)\n",
