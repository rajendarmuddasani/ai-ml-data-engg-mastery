    "## 📚 What is Supply Chain Analytics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supply Chain Analytics** applies data science and operations research techniques to optimize the flow of goods, information, and capital from suppliers to customers. It transforms supply chains from reactive (respond to problems) to **proactive and predictive** (prevent problems, capitalize on opportunities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern supply chains face unprecedented complexity: global networks spanning 100+ countries, 1000+ SKUs, volatile demand, geopolitical risks, and sustainability pressures. Analytics provides the **competitive edge** through:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Determine optimal inventory levels to minimize costs while meeting service levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three key decisions:**\n",
    "1. **Order Quantity**: How much to order each time?\n",
    "2. **Reorder Point**: When to place an order?\n",
    "3. **Safety Stock**: Buffer inventory for demand/lead time uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**\n",
    "$$Q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot D \\cdot S}{H}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $Q^*$ = Optimal order quantity\n",
    "- $D$ = Annual demand (units/year)\n",
    "- $S$ = Fixed ordering cost ($/order)\n",
    "- $H$ = Holding cost ($/unit/year)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic:** Balance ordering costs (frequent small orders) vs holding costs (large inventory)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reorder Point (ROP):**\n",
    "$$ROP = \\mu_L + z_{\\alpha} \\cdot \\sigma_L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\mu_L$ = Expected demand during lead time\n",
    "- $z_{\\alpha}$ = z-score for service level (e.g., 1.65 for 95%)\n",
    "- $\\sigma_L$ = Standard deviation of demand during lead time\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Safety Stock:**\n",
    "$$SS = z_{\\alpha} \\cdot \\sigma_L$$\n",
    "\n",

    "**Post-Silicon Application:**\n",
    "- **Component:** DRAM modules (DDR5, 16GB)\n",
    "- **Annual demand:** 260,000 units (5,000/week avg)\n",
    "- **Ordering cost:** $2,500/order (setup, shipping, processing)\n",
    "- **Holding cost:** $8/unit/year (15% of $53 unit cost)\n",
    "- **Lead time:** 4 weeks\n",
    "- **Demand variability:** σ = 800 units/week\n",
    "- **Target service level:** 98% (z = 2.05)\n",

    "**EOQ Result:**\n",

    "- Annual holding cost: $64,240 (base) + safety stock\n",
    "- Total cost: $104,740 + safety stock holding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Stock Calculation:**\n",
    "- Lead time demand: μ = 5,000 × 4 = 20,000 units\n",
    "- Lead time variability: σ_L = 800 × √4 = 1,600 units\n",
    "- Safety stock: 2.05 × 1,600 = 3,280 units\n",
    "- Safety stock holding cost: 3,280 × $8 = $26,240/year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Value:**\n",
    "- 25% inventory reduction from optimal EOQ (vs current 12,000 avg)\n",
    "- Freed capital: $314M × 25% = $78.6M\n",
    "- Annual savings: $78.6M (working capital reduction + lower holding costs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Scientific inventory management** (vs gut feel)\n",
    "- ✅ **Quantified trade-offs** (service level vs cost)\n",
    "- ✅ **Predictable replenishment** (automatic reorder triggers)\n",
    "- ✅ **Risk mitigation** (safety stock for uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **High EOQ** = Low ordering frequency, high average inventory\n",
    "- **High safety stock** = High service level, high holding costs\n",
    "- **98% service level** = 2% stockout risk (acceptable for non-critical components)"

    "## 4️⃣ Supply Chain Network Design (Facility Location)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Determine optimal locations and capacities for facilities (factories, warehouses, DCs) to minimize total supply chain costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Facility Location Problem:**\n",
    "- **Strategic decision** (long-term, high investment)\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:** Fixed costs (building facilities) vs variable costs (transportation, production)\n",
    "- **Key questions:**\n",
    "  1. How many facilities to open?\n",
    "  2. Where to locate them?\n",
    "  3. What capacity for each?\n",
    "  4. Which customers to serve from which facilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation (Uncapacitated Facility Location - UFLP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "- $y_j = 1$ if facility $j$ is opened, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- $x_{ij} = 1$ if customer $i$ is served by facility $j$, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function:**\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{j=1}^{M} f_j \\cdot y_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f_j$ = Fixed cost to open facility $j$\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$ = Cost to serve customer $i$ from facility $j$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **Each customer served by exactly one facility:**\n",
    "   $$\\sum_{j=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1 \\quad \\forall i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer can only be served from open facility:**\n",
    "   $$x_{ij} \\leq y_j \\quad \\forall i, j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacitated Version:** Add capacity constraints:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i \\cdot x_{ij} \\leq Q_j \\cdot y_j \\quad \\forall j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $d_i$ = demand from customer $i$, $Q_j$ = capacity of facility $j$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Semiconductor company planning global distribution network\n",
    "- **Facilities (potential):** 8 candidate DC locations (US, Asia, Europe)\n",
    "- **Customers:** 45 regional markets\n",
    "- **Decision horizon:** 10-year strategic plan\n",
    "- **Annual demand:** $4.2B in semiconductor components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Network (Suboptimal):**\n",
    "- 5 DCs (legacy locations, not optimized)\n",
    "- High transportation costs (inefficient coverage)\n",
    "- Annual total cost: $312M ($62M fixed + $250M transportation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Network (Facility Location Model):**\n",
    "- 4 DCs (San Jose, Singapore, Munich, Austin)\n",
    "- Strategic locations minimize global transportation\n",
    "- Annual total cost: $256M ($52M fixed + $204M transportation)\n",
    "- **Annual savings: $56M** (18% cost reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Long-term cost reduction** (strategic optimization)\n",
    "- ✅ **Risk mitigation** (geographic diversification)\n",
    "- ✅ **Service improvement** (closer to customers)\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalability** (designed for growth)\n",
    "- ✅ **Scenario planning** (test different demand patterns)"

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Supply Chain Analytics\n",
    "- **Demand forecasting**: Predict future demand with 10-20% volatility (smartphone chips: seasonal peaks, product launches)\n",
    "- **Inventory optimization**: Balance holding costs vs. stockout costs (semiconductor: long lead times 12-16 weeks)\n",
    "- **Supplier performance**: Evaluate 50+ suppliers on quality, delivery, cost (automotive: tier-1 suppliers critical)\n",
    "- **Logistics optimization**: Route planning, warehouse allocation for 100+ distribution points\n",
    "- **Risk management**: Identify supply chain vulnerabilities (single-source components, geopolitical risks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Data integration complexity**: Requires data from ERP, WMS, TMS, supplier systems (different formats, quality issues)\n",
    "- **External factor dependency**: Demand forecasting limited by unforeseeable events (pandemic, natural disasters)\n",
    "- **Lead time variability**: Optimizations assume stable lead times, but real-world has 2-3x variance\n",
    "- **Cost of mistakes**: Wrong forecast = millions in excess inventory or lost sales\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Simple moving average**: Basic forecasting (works for stable demand, no seasonality handling)\n",
    "- **Safety stock rules**: Fixed buffer inventory (e.g., 2-week safety stock) without optimization\n",
    "- **Vendor-managed inventory (VMI)**: Supplier owns inventory decisions (less control, lower complexity)\n",
    "- **Just-in-time (JIT)**: Minimize inventory (high risk if supply disrupted)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Multi-model forecasting**: Combine ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost; use ensemble (reduces forecast error 15-25%)\n",
    "- **Hierarchical forecasting**: Forecast at product family level, then disaggregate (better for sparse demand)\n",
    "- **Scenario analysis**: Model best/worst/expected cases for demand, lead time, costs\n",
    "- **ABC classification**: Prioritize high-value items (A=70% value, 10% items) for detailed analysis\n",
    "- **Continuous monitoring**: Track forecast accuracy (MAPE, bias), refit models monthly/quarterly\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Sales/marketing inputs for promotional impacts, new product launches"
