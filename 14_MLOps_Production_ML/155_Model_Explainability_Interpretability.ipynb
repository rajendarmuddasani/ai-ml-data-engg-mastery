    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Shapley values**: From cooperative game theory - fair distribution of \"payout\" (prediction) among \"players\" (features)\n",
    "- **Additivity**: Prediction = baseline + \u03a3(SHAP values) - contributions sum to total prediction\n",
    "- **Local accuracy**: SHAP explains individual predictions, not just global importance\n",
    "- **Consistency**: If feature becomes more important, SHAP value never decreases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for Post-Silicon:** When yield prediction is wrong, SHAP shows exactly which test parameters contributed how much. \"Voltage +2% contributed -5% yield, temperature +3% contributed -3% yield\" enables engineers to fix root cause, saving $15M/year in faster issue resolution."

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Understand global model behavior through feature importance rankings and partial dependence plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Permutation importance**: Measure accuracy drop when feature shuffled (model-agnostic)\n",
    "- **Tree-based importance**: Gini importance from decision trees (fast but biased)\n",
    "- **Partial dependence plots (PDP)**: Show how feature affects predictions marginally\n",
    "- **ICE plots (Individual Conditional Expectation)**: PDP for individual instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for Post-Silicon:** Global explainability reveals \"voltage is 3x more important than temperature for yield prediction\" - guides where to invest in sensor accuracy. Partial dependence plots show \"yield drops linearly above 1.05V\" - defines safe operating ranges. Enables $6.3M/year savings from targeted process improvements."

    "### \ud83d\udcdd What's Happening in This Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Build production-grade explainability dashboard for regulatory compliance and operational debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Per-prediction explanations**: Automated SHAP reports for every prediction in production\n",
    "- **Explanation logging**: Store explanations alongside predictions for audit trail\n",
    "- **Counterfactual generation**: \"What would prediction be if feature X changed?\"\n",
    "- **Explanation drift monitoring**: Track when feature importance changes (model retraining indicator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for Post-Silicon:** Automotive customers require explanation for every binning decision. Dashboard auto-generates SHAP reports showing \"Device binned as Grade-A because voltage=1.00V (baseline), current=0.48A (-2% from spec), frequency=2050MHz (+5% from spec)\" - enables $12.5M/year contract through compliance."

    "## \ud83c\udfaf Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Model Explainability\n",
    "- **Regulated industries**: Finance (FCRA), healthcare (HIPAA), insurance require explainable AI\n",
    "- **High-stakes decisions**: Credit approvals, medical diagnoses, hiring decisions need justification\n",
    "- **Model debugging**: Understand why predictions are wrong (identify data quality issues, feature bugs)\n",
    "- **Trust building**: Stakeholders accept ML recommendations when explanations provided\n",
    "- **Fairness auditing**: Detect bias in model decisions (protected attributes influencing predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Computational cost**: SHAP computation O(2^n features) for exact values, approximations still expensive (100ms+ per prediction)\n",
    "- **Interpretation complexity**: Local explanations (LIME, SHAP) may contradict global feature importance\n",
    "- **Fidelity trade-off**: Simple linear explanations of complex nonlinear models lose nuance\n",
    "- **Gaming risk**: Users learn to manipulate features highlighted as important\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Inherently interpretable models**: Linear regression, decision trees, rule-based systems (lower accuracy)\n",
    "- **Model-agnostic summaries**: Global feature importance without per-prediction explanations\n",
    "- **Counterfactual explanations**: \"Change feature X to Y to flip prediction\" (harder to compute)\n",
    "- **No explanations**: Accept black-box model, focus on validation (works if trust established)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Match explanation to audience**: SHAP for data scientists, simple feature highlighting for business users\n",
    "- **Local + global**: SHAP for individual predictions + global feature importance for overall model behavior\n",
    "- **Sanity checks**: Verify explanations align with domain knowledge (if temperature unimportant for yield, investigate)\n",
    "- **Explanation validation**: Test stability (small input changes shouldn't flip explanations completely)\n",
    "- **Performance optimization**: Precompute SHAP for representative samples, cache TreeSHAP explanations\n",
    "- **Regulatory compliance**: Document explanation methodology for audits (FCRA adverse action notices)"
