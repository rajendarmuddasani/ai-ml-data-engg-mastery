## 🛠️ Next Steps to Create Remaining Notebooks

You have the complete roadmap and 3 sample notebooks showing the quality standard. To create the remaining notebooks:

### Option 1: Create as You Learn (Recommended)
- Study each topic
- Create the notebook as you learn
- This reinforces understanding

### Option 2: Create in Batches
- Focus on one category (e.g., all regression models)
- Create 5-10 notebooks at a time
- Test and refine

### Option 3: Prioritize by Need
- Create notebooks for immediate learning goals
- Fill in others as needed

### Each New Notebook Should Have:
1. **Title & Learning Objectives**
2. **Theory Section** (with math if applicable)
3. **Code Examples** (progressive complexity)
4. **Real-World Application**
5. **Complete Project** (preferably with STDF data)
6. **Evaluation/Metrics** (for ML models)
7. **Key Takeaways**
8. **Practice Exercises**
9. **Next Steps** (link to related notebooks)

## 📊 Tracking Your Progress

Create a simple tracker:

```python
# progress.py
completed = [
    '001_DSA_Python_Mastery',
    # Add as you complete
]

total = 190
print(f"Progress: {len(completed)}/{total} ({len(completed)/total*100:.1f}%)")
```

Or create a spreadsheet:
- Notebook name
- Status (Not Started / In Progress / Completed)
- Date completed
- Project completed (Y/N)
- Notes
