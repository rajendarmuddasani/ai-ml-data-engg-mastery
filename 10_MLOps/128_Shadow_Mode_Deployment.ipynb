    "# 128: Shadow Mode Deployment - Risk-Free Model Validation and Gradual Rollouts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** shadow mode deployment for zero-risk model validation (new model runs in parallel without serving)\n",
    "- **Implement** A/B testing infrastructure for statistical model comparison\n",
    "- **Build** canary deployment for gradual rollout (5% traffic → 25% → 100%)\n",
    "- **Deploy** blue-green deployment for instant rollback capability\n",
    "- **Apply** shadow mode to semiconductor yield predictions (validate new model without affecting production decisions)\n",
    "- **Monitor** prediction differences, latency, and accuracy between models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Shadow Mode Deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shadow mode** is a deployment strategy where a **new model runs in parallel** with production, making predictions on the same inputs, but **predictions are not served** to users. This allows safe validation of model performance, latency, and behavior before full deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Shadow Mode?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Zero risk**: New model runs alongside production without affecting users (no downtime, no bad predictions)\n",
    "- ✅ **Real-world validation**: Test on actual production traffic (not just validation set)\n",
    "- ✅ **Performance comparison**: Compare accuracy, latency, prediction distribution between models\n",
    "- ✅ **Detect issues early**: Catch bugs, edge cases, or unexpected behavior before full rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment Strategies Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Risk Level | Rollout Speed | Rollback Time | Use Case |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Big Bang** | High (100% at once) | Fast (minutes) | Slow (redeploy old) | Emergency fixes only |\n",
    "| **Shadow Mode** | Zero (no traffic served) | Slow (validation takes days) | Instant (just stop shadow) | New models, major changes |\n",
    "| **Canary** | Low (5% traffic) | Medium (hours to days) | Fast (shift traffic back) | Gradual rollouts, low risk |\n",
    "| **A/B Testing** | Medium (50/50 split) | Medium (days to weeks) | Fast (shift all to winner) | Statistical comparison |\n",
    "| **Blue-Green** | Low (instant switch) | Fast (seconds) | Instant (switch back) | High availability systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 1: Shadow Mode Validation for New Yield Prediction Model**\n",
    "**Input:** New XGBoost yield prediction model (v2.0) replacing Random Forest (v1.5) in production  \n",
    "**Approach:** Run both models on 100% of wafer test data for 2 weeks, log all predictions, compare accuracy  \n",
    "**Output:** v2.0 shows 12% accuracy improvement (88% → 99%), 20ms latency increase acceptable (30ms → 50ms)  \n",
    "**Value:** $4.5M/year from improved yield prediction (fewer false positives/negatives in wafer disposition decisions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 2: Canary Deployment for Test Time Predictor**\n",
    "**Input:** Retrained test time prediction model (LightGBM) after test flow changes  \n",
    "**Approach:** Route 5% of test jobs to new model → monitor MAPE for 24 hours → increase to 25% → 100%  \n",
    "**Output:** Gradual rollout catches 15% accuracy drop on edge cases (specific device types), rollback at 25% stage  \n",
    "**Value:** $3.2M/year from preventing inaccurate test scheduling (avoid tester idle time and overtime costs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 3: A/B Testing for Parametric Outlier Detection**\n",
    "**Input:** New isolation forest algorithm vs existing LOF for parametric anomaly detection  \n",
    "**Approach:** Split wafer lots 50/50 (A: isolation forest, B: LOF), run for 1 month, compare false positive rate  \n",
    "**Output:** Isolation forest reduces false alarms by 35% (fewer good devices flagged as outliers)  \n",
    "**Value:** $2.8M/year from reduced engineering time investigating false alarms\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 4: Blue-Green Deployment for Critical Binning Model**\n",
    "**Input:** Production binning model (classifies devices into performance bins) requires zero downtime  \n",
    "**Approach:** Deploy new model to \"green\" environment → smoke test → instant traffic switch → keep \"blue\" ready for rollback  \n",
    "**Output:** Zero-downtime deployment with instant rollback capability (switch back to blue in <10 seconds)  \n",
    "**Value:** $2.1M/year from preventing production downtime (binning model must run 24/7, no interruptions allowed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Post-Silicon Value:** $4.5M + $3.2M + $2.8M + $2.1M = **$12.6M/year**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement shadow mode system that runs new model alongside production without serving predictions.\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Dual prediction**: Both models predict on same input, only production model serves result\n",
    "- **Logging**: Shadow predictions logged with metadata (timestamp, model version, confidence)\n",
    "- **Comparison**: Analyze prediction differences, accuracy, latency\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement A/B testing framework to compare models with statistical rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Traffic splitting**: 50% users see model A, 50% see model B (randomized assignment)\n",
    "- **Statistical testing**: t-test, chi-square test, or bootstrapping to validate differences\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Calculate required sample size for statistical power (typically 80%)\n",
    "- **Significance level**: α = 0.05 (95% confidence that difference is real, not random)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** A/B testing provides statistical proof that new model is better (not just lucky on test set)."

    "## 4. Canary Deployment - Gradual Traffic Rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement canary deployment strategy that gradually increases traffic to new model while monitoring metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Gradual rollout**: Start with 1-5% traffic, increase if metrics look good\n",
    "- **Automated rollback**: Revert to old model if performance degrades\n",
    "- **Health checks**: Monitor latency, error rate, accuracy in real-time\n",
    "- **Traffic control**: Adjust percentage based on confidence level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Limits blast radius of bad deployments. If new model has issues, only small fraction of users affected before automatic rollback."

    "## 5. Blue-Green Deployment - Zero Downtime Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement blue-green deployment pattern for instant traffic switching with zero downtime and quick rollback capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Two environments**: Blue (current production), Green (new version)\n",
    "- **Instant switch**: Load balancer redirects 100% traffic at once\n",
    "- **Quick rollback**: Switch back to Blue if issues detected\n",
    "- **Zero downtime**: No service interruption during deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Enables instant rollback if catastrophic issues found. Entire environment pre-validated before any user traffic hits it."

    "### Project 1: Shadow Mode Validation System for Yield Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build shadow mode system to validate new yield prediction model using 7 days of real production traffic before promoting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Value:** Zero risk validation prevents deploying models that could cause incorrect yield estimates (costly fab decisions). Shadow mode proves new model accuracy on real data patterns not in test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features to Implement:**\n",
    "- Dual prediction logging (production served, shadow logged only)\n",
    "- McNemar's test for statistical significance of accuracy difference\n",
    "- Disagreement case analysis (identify where models differ most)\n",
    "- Automated promotion decision (PROMOTE if >2% improvement + statistically significant)\n",
    "- Wafer-level correlation analysis (check if shadow degrades on specific wafer types)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Process 10,000+ production predictions through shadow mode\n",
    "- Agreement rate >95% (models mostly agree)\n",
    "- If shadow improves accuracy >2% with p<0.05, auto-promote\n",
    "- Zero production impact (shadow logging adds <5ms latency)\n",
    "- Comprehensive validation report with recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "**STDF Data Application:**\n",
