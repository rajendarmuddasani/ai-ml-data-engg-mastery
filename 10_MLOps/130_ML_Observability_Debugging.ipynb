    "# 130: ML Observability & Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** distributed tracing for ML pipelines (track data → feature → model → prediction flow)\n",
    "- **Implement** model explainability with SHAP and LIME (debug individual predictions)\n",
    "- **Build** performance profiling systems (identify latency bottlenecks in inference pipelines)\n",
    "- **Apply** error analysis techniques to post-silicon validation (root cause detection for test failures)\n",
    "- **Master** debugging strategies for production ML systems (systematic troubleshooting)\n",
    "- **Deploy** comprehensive observability dashboards (unified view of ML system health)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is ML Observability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML Observability** is the practice of monitoring, understanding, and debugging machine learning systems in production through comprehensive instrumentation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional software observability (logs, metrics, traces), ML observability adds:\n",
    "- **Model performance tracking:** Accuracy, latency, drift over time\n",
    "- **Prediction explainability:** Why did the model make this specific prediction?\n",
    "- **Feature attribution:** Which features contributed most to the prediction?\n",
    "- **Error analysis:** What patterns exist in model failures?\n",
    "- **Data quality monitoring:** Is input data within expected distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Observability:**\n",

    "**Why ML Observability?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Debug faster:** Identify root cause of prediction errors in minutes (not days)\n",
    "- ✅ **Prevent incidents:** Detect anomalies before they impact business (early warning)\n",
    "- ✅ **Explain decisions:** Provide transparency for stakeholders (regulatory compliance)\n",
    "- ✅ **Optimize performance:** Identify bottlenecks, reduce latency by 50-80%\n",
    "- ✅ **Improve models:** Learn from failures, prioritize retraining efforts\n",

    "**Use Case 1: Wafer Test Failure Root Cause Analysis**\n",
    "- **Input:** 1000 failed devices (binning model predicted fail, actual fail)\n",
    "- **Output:** Top 3 root causes (Vdd out of range → 45%, spatial correlation → 30%, temperature → 25%)\n",
    "- **Value:** Debug time reduced from 8 hours (manual inspection) → 15 minutes (automated analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 2: Test Time Optimization Debugging**\n",
    "- **Input:** Test time prediction model (predicting 45ms, actual 120ms for specific devices)\n",
    "- **Output:** Bottleneck identified (feature: device_complexity underestimated by 60%)\n",
    "- **Value:** Fix feature engineering bug → improve prediction RMSE from 30ms → 8ms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 3: Binning Model Explainability**\n",
    "- **Input:** Device binned as \"Fail\" (customer disputes, demands explanation)\n",
    "- **Output:** SHAP waterfall plot (Vdd contribution: -0.3, Idd: -0.2, frequency: -0.1 → total: -0.6 fail score)\n",
    "- **Value:** Regulatory compliance (IEEE 1505 audit trail), customer transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 4: Spatial Correlation Model Performance Profiling**\n",
    "- **Input:** Wafer map inference taking 500ms (SLA: <100ms)\n",
    "- **Output:** Latency breakdown (neighbor search: 400ms, feature compute: 80ms, model: 20ms)\n",
    "- **Value:** Optimize neighbor search (spatial index) → reduce latency 500ms → 60ms\n",

    "## 2. 🔍 Distributed Tracing for ML Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Section?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement distributed tracing to track the complete flow of ML predictions from request → feature engineering → model inference → response, capturing timing, metadata, and errors at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Trace ID propagation**: Single ID follows request through entire pipeline (correlate all operations)\n",
    "- **Span hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships (request → feature_fetch → model_predict → response)\n",
    "- **Timing instrumentation**: Capture start/end timestamps for each operation (identify bottlenecks)\n",
    "- **Context enrichment**: Attach metadata (feature values, model version, input size, cache hits)\n",
    "- **Error tracking**: Capture exceptions with full context (which stage failed, why)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- **Debug production issues:** \"Why did this specific prediction take 2 seconds?\" (answer in trace)\n",
    "- **Optimize latency:** Identify slowest operation (feature fetch: 1.5s → optimize caching)\n",
    "- **Root cause analysis:** Trace errors back to source (missing feature → upstream pipeline failure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:** Trace wafer binning prediction: STDF ingestion → feature engineering (spatial correlation) → model inference → binning decision (track end-to-end flow, identify delays)"

    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Section?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain individual predictions, debug model behavior, and identify which features contributed most to specific decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **SHAP values**: Unified measure of feature importance based on game theory (Shapley values)\n",
    "- **Additive feature attribution**: Prediction = base_value + Σ(SHAP_values) (exact decomposition)\n",
    "- **Local explanations**: Why this specific prediction? (waterfall plot shows feature contributions)\n",
    "- **Global explanations**: Which features matter most overall? (summary plot aggregates across dataset)\n",
    "- **Model-agnostic**: Works for any model (tree-based, neural networks, linear models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- **Debug predictions:** \"Why did model predict Fail for device X?\" (Vdd=-0.3, Idd=-0.2 → -0.5 total)\n",
    "- **Build trust:** Stakeholders understand model reasoning (not black box)\n",
    "- **Feature engineering:** Identify uninformative features (remove noise, improve performance)\n",
    "- **Regulatory compliance:** Provide audit trail for decisions (IEEE 1505, FDA requirements)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:** Explain wafer binning decisions: Device binned as \"Fail\" - SHAP shows Vdd contributed -0.3 (primary driver), spatial correlation -0.15 (neighboring devices also failed), temperature -0.05 (minor factor)"

    "\n",
    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Section?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Build systematic error analysis framework to identify patterns in model failures, prioritize debugging efforts, and detect root causes (data quality issues, feature engineering bugs, model limitations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Error clustering**: Group similar failures (spatial patterns, feature value ranges, temporal trends)\n",
    "- **Confusion matrix analysis**: Identify which classes are confused (Fail predicted as Pass vs Pass as Fail)\n",
    "- **Feature correlation with errors**: Which feature values predict mistakes? (errors when Vdd < 1.18V)\n",
    "- **Temporal error patterns**: Are errors increasing over time? (concept drift detection)\n",
    "- **Severity-based prioritization**: Focus on high-impact errors (false negatives in safety-critical systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- **Faster debugging:** Identify root cause in 15 minutes (not 8 hours of manual inspection)\n",
    "- **Prioritize fixes:** Focus on errors that impact business (false negatives cost $10K each)\n",
    "- **Prevent recurrence:** Fix root cause (data quality issue), not symptoms (retrain model)\n",
    "- **Improve model:** Learn from failures, add features to address systematic errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Silicon Application:** Analyze 100 test failures: 45% have Vdd < 1.18V (out-of-spec), 30% have high spatial correlation (neighboring devices failed), 25% have temperature extremes → prioritize Vdd validation in data pipeline (prevents 45% of errors)"

    "### 1. **The Three Pillars of ML Observability**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Software Observability:**\n",
    "- **Metrics:** CPU, memory, QPS, latency, error rate\n",
    "- **Logs:** Application logs, system logs, access logs\n",
    "- **Traces:** Distributed request flow across services\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML Observability Additions:**\n",
    "- **Model Performance:** Accuracy, precision, recall, drift detection\n",
    "- **Prediction Explainability:** Feature attributions, SHAP values, confidence\n",
    "- **Data Quality:** Schema validation, distribution shifts, anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unified Approach:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every ML prediction should generate:\n",
    "1. Metrics: latency, throughput, cache hit rate\n",
    "2. Logs: prediction, features, model version, timestamp\n",
    "3. Traces: request ID, span IDs for each pipeline stage\n",
    "4. Model telemetry: SHAP values, confidence, drift metrics\n",
    "5. Data quality: feature validation results, outlier flags\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why All Five:**\n",
    "- **Metrics alone:** \"Latency is 150ms\" (but why? which stage? optimization target?)\n",
    "- **Metrics + Traces:** \"Feature fetch is 100ms\" (but why slow? cache miss? data size?)\n",
    "- **Metrics + Traces + Logs:** \"Cache miss for user_123\" (but why predict wrong? features OK?)\n",
    "- **Full observability:** \"Cache miss → stale features → wrong prediction (SHAP shows outdated purchase_30d)\"\n",

    "- **Errors:** `{\"error\": \"NullPointerException\", \"stack_trace\": \"...\"}`\n",

    "- **Production:** Sample 1-5% (low overhead, sufficient for debugging)\n",
    "- **Debugging:** Sample 100% temporarily (full visibility, diagnose rare issues)\n",
    "- **Head-based sampling:** Decide at request start (consistent for entire trace)\n",
    "- **Tail-based sampling:** Decide at request end (keep only slow/error traces)\n",

    "- M: total number of features\n",

    "Interpretation: Average marginal contribution of feature i across all possible feature subsets\n",

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ML Observability\n",
    "- **Production models**: Any model serving predictions in production (100+ requests/day)\n",
    "- **Critical decisions**: High-cost errors (yield prediction, binning decisions worth $M annually)\n",
    "- **Data drift monitoring**: Input distributions change over time (new product introductions, process changes)\n",
    "- **Model performance tracking**: Detect accuracy degradation before business impact\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Investigate prediction errors, outliers, unexpected behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Metric selection**: Too many metrics = alert fatigue, too few = miss issues (balance coverage vs. noise)\n",
    "- **Lag in ground truth**: Can't compute accuracy until labels available (weeks/months for field failures)\n",
    "- **Computational overhead**: Logging all predictions + features adds latency (5-10ms typical)\n",
    "- **Storage costs**: Retaining prediction logs for analysis (GB-TB scale for high-volume services)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "- **Manual spot checks**: Periodic manual review of predictions (doesn't scale, misses systemic issues)\n",
    "- **A/B testing**: Continuous comparison to baseline model (good for improvement validation)\n",
    "- **Offline evaluation**: Batch model testing on held-out sets (misses production-specific issues)\n",
    "- **Unit tests**: Test model code correctness (doesn't catch data distribution shifts)\n",

    "- Log aggregation: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or CloudWatch Logs\n",
    "- Retention policy: 30 days for detailed logs, 1 year for aggregated metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Metrics Tracking**\n",
    "- Prediction metrics: Distribution (mean, p50, p95, p99), outlier rates (>3σ)\n",
