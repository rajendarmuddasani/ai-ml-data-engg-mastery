    "# 126: Continuous Training Pipelines - Automated Model Retraining and Drift Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** continuous training paradigm for adaptive ML systems (models auto-retrain on new data)\n",
    "- **Implement** retraining triggers based on schedules, drift detection, and performance degradation\n",
    "- **Build** automated validation gates to prevent bad models from deploying\n",
    "- **Deploy** continuous training pipelines with Airflow orchestration\n",
    "- **Apply** drift detection to post-silicon test data (detect when device characteristics change)\n",
    "- **Monitor** model performance decay and trigger timely retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Continuous Training?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous training** is the MLOps practice of **automatically retraining models** as new data arrives, concept drift occurs, or performance degrades. Unlike static models (trained once, deployed forever), continuous training keeps models fresh and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Continuous Training?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Adapt to change**: Models degrade over time as real-world patterns shift (customer behavior, device characteristics, market trends)\n",
    "- ✅ **Improve with data**: New data improves model accuracy (more training samples = better generalization)\n",
    "- ✅ **Detect drift**: Statistical tests detect data drift (input distribution changes) or concept drift (relationship between X and Y changes)\n",
    "- ✅ **Reduce manual work**: Automate retraining instead of manual model updates every quarter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Training vs Batch Retraining:**\n",
    "- **Batch**: Retrain monthly/quarterly on schedule (simple but ignores drift, may miss critical changes)\n",
    "- **Continuous**: Retrain when drift detected or performance drops (adaptive but requires monitoring infrastructure)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 1: Yield Prediction Model Continuous Retraining**\n",
    "**Input:** Yield prediction model trained on Q1 wafer test data, deployed to production  \n",
    "**Problem:** Q2 shows 15% accuracy drop (new test equipment, process changes, different lot characteristics)  \n",
    "**Output:** Drift detection triggers automatic retraining on Q2 data, model accuracy recovers to baseline  \n",
    "**Value:** $2.8M/year from preventing false-positive/false-negative yield predictions (early detection of failing devices)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 2: Parametric Test Outlier Detection with Drift Monitoring**\n",
    "**Input:** Outlier detection model for flagging suspicious test results (voltage, current, frequency out of spec)  \n",
    "**Problem:** New device generation has different parametric ranges, model flags normal devices as outliers (false alarms)  \n",
    "**Output:** Data drift detected via KS-test on parametric distributions, model retrains on new generation data  \n",
    "**Value:** $1.9M/year from reduced false alarms (engineering time saved investigating non-issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 3: Test Time Prediction with Performance-Based Retraining**\n",
    "**Input:** Regression model predicting test duration for capacity planning  \n",
    "**Problem:** Model accuracy degrades from 95% to 78% (MAPE increases) after test flow changes  \n",
    "**Output:** Performance monitoring triggers retraining when MAPE exceeds 10% threshold  \n",
    "**Value:** $1.5M/year from accurate test scheduling (optimize tester utilization, reduce idle time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 4: Wafer Map Pattern Classification Auto-Retraining**\n",
    "**Input:** CNN classifying wafer map defect patterns (edge fail, center fail, scratch, random)  \n",
    "**Problem:** New defect pattern appears (not in training data), model defaults to \"unknown\" class  \n",
    "**Output:** Schedule-based weekly retraining incorporates new labeled wafer maps, model learns new patterns  \n",
    "**Value:** $1.2M/year from faster root cause analysis (classify new defect patterns immediately)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Post-Silicon Value:** $2.8M + $1.9M + $1.5M + $1.2M = **$7.4M/year**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement trigger logic that determines WHEN to retrain models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Schedule-based triggers**: Time-based (daily, weekly, monthly) - simplest approach\n",
    "- **Drift-based triggers**: Detect data drift or concept drift using statistical tests\n",
    "- **Performance-based triggers**: Monitor production metrics (accuracy, F1, RMSE drops below threshold)\n",

    "## 7. 🎓 Key Takeaways & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Continuous Training Fundamentals**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Automated model retraining when performance degrades, data drifts, or schedule triggers\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Maintain model accuracy in production as data distributions change\n",
    "- **Components**: Triggers (when to retrain), pipeline (how to retrain), gates (when to deploy), monitoring (track performance)\n",
    "- **CT vs CI/CD**: CT focuses on model updates (data-driven), CI/CD on code updates (developer-driven) - both needed for MLOps\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why Models Degrade Over Time**\n",
    "- **Data drift**: Feature distributions change (e.g., Vdd voltage shifted from 1.2V to 1.28V due to process change)\n",
    "- **Concept drift**: Relationship between features and target changes (e.g., yield formula changes with new test coverage)\n",
    "- **Upstream changes**: Data pipeline modifications, sensor calibration, measurement errors\n",
    "- **Population shift**: Production data differs from training data (sampling bias, temporal effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without CT**: Models become stale (accuracy drops from 92% to 78% over 6 months)  \n",
    "**With CT**: Models stay fresh (maintain 90%+ accuracy indefinitely)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Trigger Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Schedule-Based Triggers**\n",
    "- **How it works**: Retrain at fixed intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple, predictable, ensures models always incorporate latest data\n",
    "- **Cons**: May retrain unnecessarily (waste compute), may miss urgent degradation between intervals\n",
    "- **When to use**: Baseline strategy for all models, sufficient when drift is gradual\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example cron schedules**:\n",
    "- Daily: `0 2 * * *` (2 AM every day - low traffic time)\n",
    "- Weekly: `0 2 * * 0` (Sunday 2 AM)\n",
    "- Monthly: `0 2 1 * *` (1st of month 2 AM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Data Drift Triggers**\n",
    "- **How it works**: Statistical tests detect distribution changes (KS test, Chi-square, PSI)\n",
    "- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test**: Compare training vs production distributions (p-value < 0.05 → drift)\n",
    "- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**: Measure distribution shift (PSI > 0.2 = significant drift)\n",
    "- **Per-feature drift**: Test each feature independently, trigger if >=20% features drift\n",
    "- **Pros**: Data-driven (retrain only when needed), catch drift before performance degrades\n",
    "- **Cons**: Requires production data logging, threshold tuning (too sensitive = false alarms)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy.stats import ks_2samp\n",
    "\n",
    "for feature in feature_cols:\n",
    "    statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(train_data[feature], prod_data[feature])\n",
    "    if p_value < 0.05:  # Reject null hypothesis (distributions differ)\n",
    "        trigger_retrain(reason=f\"Drift in {feature}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Performance-Based Triggers**\n",
    "- **How it works**: Monitor production metrics (accuracy, F1, MAPE), retrain if below threshold\n",
    "- **Requires**: Ground truth labels in production (e.g., yield labels after test completion)\n",
    "- **Metrics to track**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC, MAPE, RMSE (depends on problem)\n",
    "- **Threshold setting**: Historical baseline - 5% (e.g., if baseline 90%, trigger at 85%)\n",
    "- **Pros**: Directly tied to business impact, no false alarms (only retrain when truly needed)\n",
    "- **Cons**: Reactive (waits for degradation), requires labeled production data (not always available)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rolling window validation**: Evaluate on last 7 days of production data to detect gradual degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Hybrid Trigger Strategies**\n",
    "- **Combine multiple triggers**: Schedule AND (drift OR performance) - ensures regular updates + urgency\n",
    "- **Priority levels**: Performance drop (urgent, retrain immediately) > Data drift (important, retrain next cycle) > Schedule (routine)\n",
    "- **Override mechanisms**: Manual trigger for emergencies (spec change, major bug fix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example logic**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "should_retrain = (\n",
    "    schedule_trigger.triggered() OR\n",
    "    (drift_trigger.triggered() AND performance_trigger.degraded()) OR\n",
    "    manual_override\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Retraining Pipeline Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Pipeline Stages**\n",
    "1. **Data fetching**: Pull latest data from production (last 30-90 days typically)\n",
    "2. **Feature engineering**: Apply same transformations as training (use feature store for consistency)\n",
    "3. **Model training**: Train with same hyperparameters OR run hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Check quality on holdout set (last 20% of data or time-based split)\n",
    "5. **Deployment**: If passed gates, replace production model (with rollback capability)\n",
    "6. **Monitoring**: Track new model performance in production (A/B test, shadow mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Validation Gates (Quality Checks)**\n",
    "- **Absolute threshold**: Accuracy >= 85% (minimum acceptable performance)\n",
    "- **Relative threshold**: New model >= production model + 1% (ensure improvement)\n",
    "- **Business rules**: No predictions of >15% yield loss (unrealistic, likely bug)\n",
    "- **Fairness checks**: Accuracy variance across demographics/fabs < 5%\n",
    "- **Latency constraints**: Inference time < 100ms (real-time applications)\n",
    "- **All gates must pass**: If any gate fails, reject model (keep production model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example validation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_model(new_model, prod_model, X_val, y_val):\n",
    "    new_acc = accuracy_score(y_val, new_model.predict(X_val))\n",
    "    prod_acc = accuracy_score(y_val, prod_model.predict(X_val))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    gates = {\n",
    "        'absolute': new_acc >= 0.85,\n",
    "        'relative': new_acc >= prod_acc + 0.01,\n",
    "        'f1': f1_score(y_val, new_model.predict(X_val)) >= 0.75\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return all(gates.values())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Model Versioning & Rollback**\n",
    "- **Version tracking**: Store model with metadata (timestamp, trigger reason, metrics, Git commit)\n",
    "- **Registry**: Use MLflow, W&B, or custom registry to track all versions\n",
    "- **Rollback**: If new model fails in production (detected by monitoring), revert to previous version\n",
    "- **Retention**: Keep last 5-10 versions for quick rollback, archive older versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata example**:\n",

    "- **Value**: Maintain yield prediction accuracy → prevent $2M/year scrap losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Test Time Prediction CT**\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Test programs change frequently (new tests, sequence updates)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Event-driven trigger (Git commit to test program) + nightly retrain\n",
    "- **Validation**: MAPE <= 4%, prediction time < 50ms\n",
    "- **Value**: Accurate capacity planning → prevent 20% test floor underutilization ($500K/year)\n",

    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. Retraining Too Frequently**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Daily retraining when drift is slow → waste compute, increase complexity\n",
    "- **Solution**: Start with weekly/monthly schedule, add drift triggers only if needed\n",
    "- **Cost**: Daily retraining can cost $1000+/month in cloud compute (vs $100/month weekly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**18. Insufficient Validation**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Deploy new model without proper testing → production failures\n",
    "- **Solution**: Multiple validation gates (accuracy, fairness, business rules), A/B testing before full deployment\n",
    "- **Example failure**: New model predicts 50% yield loss (bug) → deploys → fab halts production\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. Ignoring Data Quality**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Retrain on corrupted data (sensor failure, pipeline bug) → model worse than before\n",
    "- **Solution**: Data quality checks before training (missing values, outliers, schema validation)\n",
    "- **Example**: Vdd sensor malfunction reports 0V → model learns incorrect pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**20. No Rollback Plan**\n",
    "- **Problem**: New model degrades in production, no way to revert quickly\n",
    "- **Solution**: Keep last 3-5 model versions, automated rollback on performance drop\n",
    "- **Detection**: Monitor rolling 24-hour accuracy, rollback if drops >3%\n",
    "\n",
    "**21. Training-Serving Skew**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Features computed differently in training vs production → model fails\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use feature store (consistent feature definitions), validate feature distributions\n",
    "- **Example**: Training uses offline batch features, production uses real-time features → different values\n",
    "\n",
    "**22. Overfitting to Recent Data**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Retrain on last 7 days only → model forgets long-term patterns\n",
    "- **Solution**: Use last 30-90 days of data, balance recent (high weight) + historical (low weight)\n",
    "- **Weighting**: Recent data 2x weight, older data 1x weight (time-based importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**23. Start Simple, Iterate**\n",
    "- **Phase 1**: Manual retraining (understand drift patterns)\n",
    "- **Phase 2**: Scheduled retraining (weekly/monthly)\n",
    "- **Phase 3**: Add drift detection triggers\n",
    "- **Phase 4**: Add performance triggers + A/B testing\n",
    "- **Don't**: Build complex multi-trigger system on day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**24. Monitor Everything**\n",
    "- **Training metrics**: Accuracy, F1, training time, data volume\n",
    "- **Deployment metrics**: Models deployed, rejected, rolled back\n",
    "- **Production metrics**: Inference latency, throughput, error rate\n",
    "- **Business metrics**: Revenue impact, cost savings (tie CT to ROI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**25. Automate Validation Reports**\n",
    "- **Generate**: Comparison report (new model vs production model)\n",
    "- **Include**: Metrics, feature importances, prediction distributions, validation gate results\n",
    "- **Share**: Email to team after each retrain (transparency)\n",
    "\n",
    "**26. Handle Edge Cases**\n",
    "- **Insufficient data**: If <1000 samples in retrain window, skip retrain (wait for more data)\n",
    "- **Training failures**: Retry 2x, if still fails, alert team (don't deploy broken model)\n",
    "- **Validation failures**: Log reason (which gate failed), investigate (data quality? threshold too strict?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**27. Document Trigger Decisions**\n",
    "- **Log**: Every trigger check (timestamp, trigger type, decision, reason)\n",
    "- **Dashboard**: Show trigger history (when did we retrain? why?)\n",
    "- **Analyze**: Review trigger patterns monthly (are we retraining too much? too little?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**28. Use A/B Testing Before Full Deployment**\n",
    "- **Shadow mode**: Run new model in parallel with production (log predictions, don't serve)\n",
    "- **A/B test**: Serve new model to 10% of traffic for 24 hours\n",
    "- **Full deployment**: If A/B test passes, deploy to 100%\n",
    "- **Safety**: Limits blast radius if new model has issues\n",

    "**✅ Use CT when**:\n",
    "- Data distributions change over time (seasonality, trends, process changes)\n",
    "- Model performance degrades in production (drift, concept shift)\n",
    "- New data arrives regularly (daily/weekly production data)\n",
    "- Business requires up-to-date models (fraud, recommendations, demand forecasting)\n",
    "- Cost of stale model is high (lost revenue, safety risk)\n",

    "- Model performance is stable (no degradation over 6+ months)\n",
    "- Retraining cost > benefit (expensive training, minimal accuracy gain)\n",
    "- Business doesn't require freshness (historical analysis, one-time prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives**:\n",
    "- **Manual retraining**: Retrain when performance drops (alerts trigger manual investigation)\n",
    "- **Online learning**: Update model incrementally with each new sample (no batch retraining)\n",
    "- **Ensemble with new models**: Keep old model, add new model, ensemble predictions\n",
