    "# 127: Model Governance & Compliance - Model Cards, Bias Detection, and Regulatory Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- **Understand** model governance framework for transparency, fairness, and compliance\n",
    "- **Implement** model cards for comprehensive model documentation (Google's ML transparency standard)\n",
    "- **Detect** bias in ML models using fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact)\n",
    "- **Apply** explainability techniques to semiconductor test models (SHAP, LIME for parametric predictions)\n",
    "- **Build** compliance frameworks for regulated industries (GDPR, CCPA, FDA, SOX, industry-specific regulations)\n",
    "- **Monitor** model governance metrics and audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Model Governance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model governance** is the set of **policies, processes, and controls** ensuring ML models are developed, deployed, and monitored **ethically, transparently, and in compliance** with regulations. It answers: Who built this model? What data was used? How accurate is it? Is it fair? Who approved deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Model Governance?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Regulatory compliance**: GDPR (right to explanation), CCPA (data privacy), FDA (medical device ML), SOX (financial models)\n",
    "- ✅ **Risk management**: Prevent discriminatory models, detect bias before deployment, audit trail for incidents\n",
    "- ✅ **Trust and transparency**: Stakeholders understand model decisions (engineering, legal, customers)\n",
    "- ✅ **Reproducibility**: Document training data, hyperparameters, validation metrics (recreate model from scratch)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Governance Components:**\n",
    "- **Model Cards**: Standardized documentation (purpose, performance, limitations, fairness, ethical considerations)\n",
    "- **Bias Detection**: Statistical tests for demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact ratios\n",
    "- **Explainability**: SHAP values, LIME, feature importance (understand which features drive predictions)\n",
    "- **Audit Logs**: Track who trained, deployed, accessed model (compliance, security, debugging)\n",
    "- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval (data scientist → ML engineer → compliance → deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Post-Silicon Validation Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 1: Yield Prediction Model Card for Regulatory Compliance**\n",
    "**Input:** Yield prediction model used for wafer disposition (ship vs scrap decisions worth $50K-$500K per lot)  \n",
    "**Output:** Model card documenting training data, accuracy metrics, limitations, approval chain  \n",
    "**Value:** $3.2M/year from avoiding compliance violations (SOX requires audit trail for financial decisions, model card provides documentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 2: Bias Detection in Test Coverage Optimization**\n",
    "**Input:** ML model recommending which tests to skip for faster test time (adaptive testing)  \n",
    "**Problem:** Model skips critical tests for certain device types (bias against edge cases)  \n",
    "**Output:** Fairness metrics detect disparate impact (some device families under-tested), model retrained with balanced sampling  \n",
    "**Value:** $2.5M/year from preventing field failures (catch defects before shipping, avoid recalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 3: SHAP Explainability for Parametric Outlier Detection**\n",
    "**Input:** Random Forest flagging parametric test results as outliers (voltage, current, frequency anomalies)  \n",
    "**Problem:** Engineers don't trust black-box model (why was this flagged? which parameter out of spec?)  \n",
    "**Output:** SHAP values explain each prediction (e.g., \"voltage 3.5V vs expected 3.3V contributed 80% to outlier score\")  \n",
    "**Value:** $1.9M/year from faster root cause analysis (engineers debug test failures 50% faster with explanations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case 4: Audit Trail for Model Deployment Approvals**\n",
    "**Input:** Production ML models deployed without approval tracking (who authorized deployment? when? based on what validation?)  \n",
    "**Output:** Governance system logs all model deployments with approvals, validation metrics, rollback capability  \n",
    "**Value:** $1.6M/year from risk mitigation (prevent unapproved model deployments, compliance with internal controls)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Post-Silicon Value:** $3.2M + $2.5M + $1.9M + $1.6M = **$9.2M/year**\n",

    "**Purpose:** Implement compliance checks for major AI/ML regulations (GDPR, AI Act, SR 11-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **GDPR (EU)**: Right to explanation (Article 22), data protection, consent, privacy\n",
    "- **AI Act (EU)**: Risk classification (high-risk systems require documentation, testing, human oversight)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📌 Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Model Governance Fundamentals**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Framework of policies, procedures, and controls ensuring responsible ML model development and deployment\n",
    "- **Components**: Documentation (model cards), fairness (bias detection), transparency (explainability), compliance (regulations), accountability (audit trails)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensure models are trustworthy, fair, compliant, and beneficial\n",
    "- **Governance vs MLOps**: MLOps = HOW to deploy (technical), Governance = WHAT models must satisfy (policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without governance**: Models cause harm (discrimination, privacy violations), regulatory fines ($50M+ GDPR), reputational damage  \n",
    "**With governance**: Responsible AI adoption, stakeholder trust, regulatory compliance, reduced legal risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why Governance Matters**\n",
    "- **Regulatory landscape**: GDPR (EU data protection), AI Act (EU high-risk systems), SR 11-7 (US banking), CCPA (California privacy)\n",
    "- **Financial risk**: GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% revenue (whichever higher), discrimination lawsuits ($millions)\n",
    "- **Reputational risk**: Biased models damage brand (Amazon hiring AI, facial recognition bias)\n",
    "- **Ethical obligation**: ML impacts lives (credit, healthcare, hiring) - must be fair and explainable\n",
    "- **Market access**: EU AI Act restricts high-risk AI without compliance (lose market access)\n",

    "### 📄 Model Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Model Card Structure**\n",
    "- **Model details**: Name, version, type, developer, framework, training date\n",
    "- **Intended use**: Primary uses, out-of-scope uses, primary users\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Overall performance + per-group metrics (fairness)\n",
    "- **Training data**: Source, size, time period, features\n",
    "- **Evaluation data**: Test set characteristics\n",
    "- **Ethical considerations**: Fairness assessment, bias mitigation, privacy measures\n",

    "- **Living document**: Update with each model version, retraining, or performance change\n",
    "- **Multiple formats**: JSON (machine-readable), Markdown (human-readable), HTML (web display)\n",
    "- **Audience-specific**: Technical (data scientists), business (executives), compliance (auditors, regulators)\n",
    "- **Versioning**: Track model card versions alongside model versions (lineage)\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Store in model registry, share with stakeholders, publish for transparency\n",

    "### ⚖️ Fairness & Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Fairness Metrics**\n",
    "- **Demographic parity**: Positive rate similar across groups (P(pred=1 | group=A) ≈ P(pred=1 | group=B))\n",
    "- **Equalized odds**: TPR and FPR equal across groups (equal true positive and false positive rates)\n",
    "- **Disparate impact**: Ratio of positive rates >= 0.8 (80% rule from US employment law)\n",
    "- **Accuracy parity**: Accuracy similar across groups (<5% variance typically acceptable)\n",
    "- **Calibration**: Predicted probabilities match observed frequencies per group\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. When to Use Which Metric**\n",
    "- **Demographic parity**: Use when outcome rates should be similar (hiring, lending approval rates)\n",
    "- **Equalized odds**: Use when error rates matter equally (healthcare diagnosis - minimize both false positives and false negatives)\n",
    "- **Disparate impact**: Use for legal compliance (hiring, lending - 80% rule)\n",
    "- **Accuracy parity**: Use when performance should be consistent (product quality, yield prediction across fabs)\n",
    "- **Multiple metrics**: Check ALL metrics (model can pass one, fail another)\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Bias Mitigation Strategies**\n",
    "- **Pre-processing**: Reweight training data, resample to balance groups, remove biased features\n",
    "- **In-processing**: Fairness-aware algorithms (constrained optimization), adversarial debiasing\n",
    "- **Post-processing**: Adjust decision thresholds per group (equalize error rates)\n",
    "- **Feature engineering**: Remove proxies (zip code → race, name → gender)\n",
    "- **Diverse data**: Ensure training set represents all groups (no underrepresentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tradeoff**: Fairness vs accuracy (often 2-5% accuracy drop to achieve fairness) - business decision based on ethics/regulations\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Immutable logs**: Append-only (cannot modify past events), cryptographic hashing for tamper-evidence\n",
    "- **Structured format**: JSON for machine-readability, queryable database (SQL)\n",
    "- **Retention**: Keep logs for regulatory period (7 years for SR 11-7, indefinitely for litigation risk)\n",
    "- **Access control**: Only authorized users can view audit logs (privacy, security)\n",
    "- **Automated alerts**: Flag suspicious events (unauthorized deployment, fairness violations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Model Lineage**\n",
    "- **Data lineage**: Training data → preprocessing → features → training dataset\n",
    "- **Code lineage**: Git commit, dependencies (requirements.txt), environment (Docker image)\n",

    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. Documentation as Afterthought**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Create model card after deployment (outdated, incomplete)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Generate model card DURING development (update with each experiment)\n",
    "- **Tooling**: Automate model card generation from MLflow tracking, experiment metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**20. Ignoring Fairness Until Production**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Discover bias after deployment (costly to fix, reputational damage)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Fairness evaluation in development (before deployment), continuous fairness monitoring\n",
    "- **Example**: Amazon hiring AI discontinued after discovering gender bias (trained on historical male-dominated data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**21. Audit Trails Without Context**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Log events without WHY (hard to understand decisions during audit)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Log context (trigger reason, approval rationale, incident root cause)\n",
    "- **Example**: \\\"Model retrained\\\" (useless) vs \\\"Model retrained due to data drift in Vdd distribution (KS test p=0.02)\\\" (useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "**22. Compliance Checkbox Exercise**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Treat governance as bureaucracy (check boxes without understanding)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Understand WHY regulations exist (protect users, ensure fairness), embed in culture\n",
    "- **Mindset**: Governance enables responsible AI (not just compliance burden)\n",
    "\n",
    "**23. One-Size-Fits-All Governance**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Same governance for low-risk recommendation (movie suggestions) and high-risk lending (credit approval)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Risk-based governance (more rigor for high-risk systems)\n",
    "- **Tiers**: Minimal (internal analytics), Standard (customer-facing), High (safety/financial/legal critical)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**24. Risk-Based Governance**\n",
    "- **Risk classification**: Categorize models by impact (low/medium/high/critical)\n",
    "- **Governance intensity**: More requirements for higher risk (high-risk needs audit trail, fairness, approval)\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Low risk: Internal analytics dashboard (minimal governance)\n",
    "  - Medium risk: Yield prediction (model card, fairness monitoring)\n",
    "  - High risk: Credit scoring (full governance, compliance checks, audit trail)\n",
    "  - Critical risk: Medical diagnosis (maximum governance, regulatory approval, human oversight)\n",
    "\n",
    "**25. Governance-by-Design**\n",
    "- **Integrate early**: Build governance into ML workflow (not bolted on later)\n",
    "- **Automated checks**: Fairness tests in CI/CD, compliance validation in deployment pipeline\n",
    "- **Templates**: Standardize model cards, fairness reports, compliance checklists (reduce burden)\n",
    "\n",
    "**26. Stakeholder Engagement**\n",
    "- **Cross-functional teams**: Data scientists, legal, compliance, business, ethics\n",
    "- **Regular reviews**: Quarterly governance reviews (fairness, compliance, incidents)\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Share model cards with stakeholders (build trust)\n",
    "\n",
    "**27. Continuous Monitoring**\n",
    "- **Fairness drift**: Fairness metrics can degrade over time (monitor quarterly)\n",
    "- **Compliance changes**: Regulations evolve (AI Act, state laws) - stay updated\n",
    "- **Incident tracking**: Log all governance incidents (bias complaints, compliance violations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**28. Documentation Standards**\n",
    "- **Version control**: Model cards versioned with models (Git, model registry)\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Store in central location (model registry, wiki, compliance database)\n",
    "- **Formats**: Multiple formats (JSON for automation, Markdown for humans, HTML for web)\n",
    "- **Reviews**: Peer review model cards (catch gaps, ensure accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🎯 When to Prioritize Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Prioritize governance when**:\n",
    "- High-risk systems (healthcare, finance, hiring, safety-critical)\n",
    "- Customer-facing models (impact user experience, trust)\n",
    "- Regulated industries (banking, healthcare, public sector)\n",
    "- Protected characteristics involved (race, gender, age - fairness critical)\n",
    "- High-stakes decisions ($millions impact, legal consequences)\n",
    "- Multi-year deployment (governance ensures long-term trust)\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Lower priority when**:\n",
    "- Internal analytics (no user impact, low risk)\n",
    "- Experimental models (prototypes, not production)\n",
    "- Low-stakes decisions (movie recommendations, UI optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling governance**: Start simple (model card for all models), add rigor for high-risk (fairness, compliance, audit trails)\n",

    "**🎯 Remember**: Governance is not optional for production ML in 2024+. Regulations (GDPR, AI Act) mandate documentation, fairness, and transparency. Start governance early, automate where possible, and treat it as enabler (not burden) for responsible AI adoption. The cost of governance ($thousands) is far less than the cost of non-compliance ($millions in fines + reputational damage)."

    "## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Model Governance:**\n",
    "- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government)\n",
    "- High-stakes decisions (hiring, lending, medical diagnosis)\n",
    "- Multiple teams deploying models\n",
    "- Audit and compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Adds overhead to deployment process\n",
    "- Requires dedicated governance team/tools\n",
    "- Documentation burden on data scientists\n",
    "- May slow down experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives:**\n",
    "- Lightweight documentation (README + model cards)\n",
    "- Peer review process without formal governance\n",
    "- Third-party compliance platforms (Fiddler, Arthur)\n",
    "- Manual audits (periodic vs continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Automate documentation generation where possible\n",
    "- Integrate governance into CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "- Maintain model registry with lineage tracking\n",
    "- Conduct regular governance audits\n",
    "- Train teams on compliance requirements\n",
