# 04 - Distance-Based Models

**Purpose:** Master instance-based and margin-based learning algorithms

## Notebooks

- **023_K_Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb** - KNN, distance metrics, K selection, curse of dimensionality, KD-tree/Ball tree
- **024_Support_Vector_Machines.ipynb** - SVM/SVC/SVR, kernels (linear/RBF/poly), C/gamma tuning, maximum margin
- **025_Naive_Bayes.ipynb** - Gaussian/Multinomial/Bernoulli, Bayes' theorem, conditional independence, real-time inference

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand lazy learning (KNN stores all data)
- Master kernel trick for non-linear classification
- Apply to semiconductor failure detection (similar die matching)
- Build probabilistic classifiers with < 10ms inference
- Handle high-dimensional data with appropriate metrics

## Prerequisites

- **02_Regression_Models** (classification basics)
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine)
- Probability theory (Bayes' theorem)

## Next Steps

Move to **05_Clustering** for unsupervised learning.
