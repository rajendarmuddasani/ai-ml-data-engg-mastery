    "## 📐 Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bayes' Theorem (The Core)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given features $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ and class label $Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y) \\cdot P(Y)}{P(X)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "- **$P(Y|X)$**: **Posterior** - Probability of class $Y$ given features $X$ (what we predict)\n",
    "- **$P(X|Y)$**: **Likelihood** - Probability of observing features $X$ given class $Y$\n",
    "- **$P(Y)$**: **Prior** - Probability of class $Y$ before seeing data\n",
    "- **$P(X)$**: **Evidence** - Probability of observing features $X$ (normalization constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The \"Naive\" Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Computing $P(X|Y)$ for high-dimensional $X$ is intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Assume features are **conditionally independent** given the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X|Y) = P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i|Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Naive\"?** \n",
    "This assumption is rarely true in practice (e.g., in text, \"good\" and \"excellent\" are correlated), but the classifier often works well anyway!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Classification Decision Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For each class $c$, compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y=c|X) \\propto P(Y=c) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i|Y=c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predict:** $\\hat{Y} = \\arg\\max_c P(Y=c|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(X)$ is constant across classes, we can ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Log-Space Computation (Numerical Stability)\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid underflow from multiplying many small probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log P(Y=c|X) = \\log P(Y=c) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log P(x_i|Y=c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predict:** $\\hat{Y} = \\arg\\max_c \\log P(Y=c|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Likelihood Functions by Variant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Gaussian Naive Bayes (Continuous Features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes each feature follows a Gaussian distribution per class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i|Y=c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{ic}^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu_{ic})^2}{2\\sigma_{ic}^2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu_{ic}$: Mean of feature $i$ for class $c$\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{ic}^2$: Variance of feature $i$ for class $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**: Compute $\\mu_{ic}$ and $\\sigma_{ic}^2$ from training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Multinomial Naive Bayes (Count Features)\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete count data (e.g., word counts in documents):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i|Y=c) = \\frac{N_{ic} + \\alpha}{N_c + \\alpha d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N_{ic}$: Count of feature $i$ in class $c$\n",
    "- $N_c$: Total count of all features in class $c$\n",
    "- $\\alpha$: Laplace smoothing parameter (typically 1)\n",
    "- $d$: Number of features (vocabulary size)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Bernoulli Naive Bayes (Binary Features)\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary features (present/absent):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i|Y=c) = p_{ic}^{x_i} \\cdot (1 - p_{ic})^{1-x_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_{ic}$: Probability that feature $i$ is present in class $c$\n",
    "- $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Laplace Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: If a feature never appears with a class in training, $P(x_i|Y=c) = 0$, causing the entire posterior to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Add pseudo-counts $\\alpha$ (usually 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i|Y=c) = \\frac{\\text{count}(x_i, c) + \\alpha}{\\text{count}(c) + \\alpha \\cdot |\\text{features}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Post-Silicon Validation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Classify devices as PASS/FAIL based on test parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**: [Vdd_voltage, Idd_current, frequency, temperature]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**:\n",
    "1. Compute $P(\\text{PASS})$ and $P(\\text{FAIL})$ from historical data\n",
    "2. For each feature, compute mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ per class\n",
    "3. For new device, compute $P(\\text{PASS}|X)$ and $P(\\text{FAIL}|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: Fast screening (no model training needed after computing statistics)"

    "\n",
    "### When to Use Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **BEST FOR:**\n",
    "- **Text classification** (spam, sentiment, document categorization)\n",
    "- **Real-time predictions** (low latency critical)\n",
    "- **Small training datasets** (works with limited data)\n",
    "- **Baseline models** (fast to implement and iterate)\n",
    "- **Probability estimates needed** (risk-based decisions)\n",
    "- **High-dimensional data** (many features, scales well)\n",
    "- **Streaming/online learning** (easy to update incrementally)\n",
    "- **Post-silicon**: Fast parametric screening, initial triage\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **AVOID WHEN:**\n",
    "- **Features are highly correlated** (violates independence assumption)\n",
    "- **Decision boundaries are complex/non-linear** (use SVM, neural nets)\n",
    "- **Maximum accuracy required** (Naive Bayes trades accuracy for speed)\n",
    "- **Feature interactions critical** (e.g., x1*x2 matters, not just x1 and x2)\n",
    "- **Small number of samples per class** (insufficient for reliable statistics)\n",

    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blazing Fast Training**: Just compute means/variances per class (closed-form solution)\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Inference**: Evaluate Gaussian PDF + sum logs → sub-millisecond predictions\n",
    "3. **Probability Calibration**: Unlike SVM, outputs are actual probabilities (good for risk-based decisions)\n",
    "4. **Scales to High Dimensions**: Works well with thousands of features (text, genomics)\n",
    "5. **Small Data Friendly**: Can work with limited training samples\n",
    "6. **Simple to Implement**: Minimal hyperparameters, easy to understand and debug\n",
    "7. **Incremental Learning**: Easy to update with new data without full retraining\n",
    "8. **Robust to Irrelevant Features**: Irrelevant features get low likelihoods, minimal impact\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Naive\" Assumption Rarely Holds**: Real-world features are often correlated\n",
    "   - **Example**: In text, \"machine\" and \"learning\" co-occur (not independent)\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Can underperform when correlations are strong\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Feature selection to remove redundant/correlated features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gaussian Assumption May Be Wrong**: Real data may not be normally distributed\n",
    "   - **Example**: Device test data may have multimodal or skewed distributions\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Poor class boundaries if distributions are non-Gaussian\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Transform features (log, Box-Cox), use Kernel Density Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Frequency Problem**: If a feature never appears with a class in training\n",
    "   - **Example**: Word \"viagra\" never appears in ham emails during training\n",
    "   - **Impact**: P(word|ham) = 0 → entire posterior becomes 0\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Laplace smoothing (add pseudo-counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sensitive to Irrelevant Features**: While robust, too many noise features hurt\n",
    "   - **Example**: Including random features dilutes signal\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Accumulation of small errors across many features\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Feature selection, regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cannot Learn Feature Interactions**: Treats all features independently\n",
    "   - **Example**: Can't learn that high_Vdd AND high_Idd together indicate failure\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Misses combinatorial patterns\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Manually engineer interaction features (x1*x2, x1/x2)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Class Imbalance Issues**: Priors dominate when classes are heavily imbalanced\n",
    "   - **Example**: 99% PASS, 1% FAIL → model predicts PASS for everything\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Poor minority class recall\n",
    "   - **Mitigation**: Cost-sensitive learning, SMOTE, Complement Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- Remove highly correlated features (correlation > 0.9)\n",
    "- Transform non-Gaussian features (log, sqrt, Box-Cox)\n",
    "- Create interaction features for known dependencies\n",
    "- Normalize/standardize continuous features for better Gaussian fit\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Variant Selection**\n",
    "- **Gaussian NB**: Continuous features (test parameters, sensor data)\n",
    "- **Multinomial NB**: Count data (word frequencies, event counts)\n",
    "- **Bernoulli NB**: Binary features (symptom presence, flags)\n",
    "- **Complement NB**: Imbalanced text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- `var_smoothing`: Add to variances for stability (default 1e-9, try 1e-8 to 1e-10)\n",
    "- Laplace `alpha`: For Multinomial/Bernoulli (default 1.0, try 0.1 to 10)\n",
    "- `class_prior`: Can specify manually if training distribution ≠ production distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Model Validation**\n",
    "- **Check Gaussian Assumption**: Plot feature distributions per class, Q-Q plots\n",
    "- **Inspect Learned Parameters**: Verify means/variances make sense domain-wise\n",
    "- **Probability Calibration**: Use calibration curves to validate probability estimates\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Essential for small datasets, use stratified k-fold\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Production Deployment**\n",
    "- **Hybrid Approach**: Naive Bayes for fast screening + SVM for borderline cases\n",
    "- **Confidence Thresholding**: Route low-confidence predictions to human review\n",
    "- **Incremental Updates**: Retrain periodically with new data (weekly/monthly)\n",
    "- **Monitor Drift**: Track accuracy over time, retrain if performance degrades\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Calibration Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes probabilities are generally well-calibrated, but verify:\n",
    "- **Calibration Curve**: Plot predicted probability vs actual frequency\n",
    "- **Expected**: Should lie on diagonal (predicted 70% → 70% actual positive rate)\n",
    "- **If Miscalibrated**: Use Platt scaling or isotonic regression post-training\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training**: $O(n \\cdot d \\cdot k)$ where n=samples, d=features, k=classes\n",
    "  - Just compute means/variances → very fast\n",
    "- **Prediction**: $O(d \\cdot k)$ per sample\n",
    "  - Evaluate Gaussian PDF for each feature-class pair\n",
    "- **Memory**: $O(d \\cdot k)$ to store means/variances\n",
    "  - Tiny compared to SVM's support vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: 1M samples, 1000 features, 10 classes\n",
    "- Training: <1 second\n",
    "- Prediction: <0.01ms per sample\n",
    "- Memory: ~80KB (1000 features × 10 classes × 8 bytes)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Silicon Validation Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast Screening + Precise Refinement**: Naive Bayes (1st pass) → SVM (borderline cases)\n",
    "2. **Probability-Based Routing**: \n",
    "   - P(PASS) > 0.95 → Ship immediately\n",
    "   - 0.5 < P(PASS) < 0.95 → Standard retest\n",
    "   - P(PASS) < 0.5 → Deep analysis\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**: Use parametric tests most correlated with failures\n",
    "4. **Adaptive Learning**: Retrain weekly on latest failures to adapt to process drift\n",
    "5. **Ensemble with Domain Rules**: Combine NB probabilities with hard limits (e.g., Vdd < 1.7V → FAIL)\n",
