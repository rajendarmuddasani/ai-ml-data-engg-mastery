    "- **Convolutional Architecture**: Replace FC layers with Conv/TransposeConv for spatial structure\n",
    "- **BatchNormalization**: Stabilizes training, allows higher learning rates\n",
    "- **LeakyReLU in D, ReLU in G**: Proven activation choices from DCGAN paper\n",

    "- **Spatial Structure**: Convolutional layers preserve 2D image structure\n",
    "- **Fewer Parameters**: Weight sharing in convolutions \u2192 more efficient\n",
    "- **Stable Training**: BatchNorm + architectural constraints \u2192 less mode collapse\n",
    "- **Higher Quality**: Produces sharper, more realistic images than vanilla GAN\n",

    "- Vanilla: 784 \u2192 FC \u2192 FC \u2192 FC \u2192 784 (no spatial structure)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Vanilla GAN generates random samples** - you can't control what digit it produces:\n",
    "- Input: Random noise z\n",
    "- Output: Random digit (could be 0, 1, 2, ..., 9)\n",
    "- No control over the output class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This is Limiting:**\n",
    "- Can't generate specific digits on demand\n",
    "- Can't balance dataset (e.g., generate more rare classes)\n",
    "- Can't test specific scenarios (e.g., \"generate digit 7\")\n",

    "   - Gradient is zero \u2192 Generator stops learning\n",
    "   - Happens early in training (bad random generator)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mode Collapse**: Generator finds one mode that fools D, ignores rest\n",
    "   - Example: Only generates digit \"1\", ignores other digits\n",
    "   - JS divergence doesn't penalize missing modes effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unstable Training**: Loss doesn't correlate with image quality\n",
    "   - D loss = 0.5, G loss = 0.7 \u2192 good images?\n",
    "   - No way to know if training is progressing\n",

    "- Can't directly compare $p_{data}$ and $p_g$\n",
    "- Need indirect metrics\n",

    "### 4.1 Inception Score (IS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea**: Good images should be:\n",
    "1. **Clear**: Model confident about class (low entropy)\n",
    "2. **Diverse**: Uniform class distribution (high entropy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{IS} = \\exp\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_g}[\\text{KL}(p(y|x) || p(y))]\\right)\n",

    "- $p(y) = \\mathbb{E}_x[p(y|x)]$: Marginal class distribution\n",

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Low IS (< 2)**: Blurry images or no diversity\n",
    "- **Medium IS (2-5)**: Decent quality\n",
    "- **High IS (> 8)**: High quality and diverse\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- \u26a0\ufe0f Only works for ImageNet classes\n",
    "- \u26a0\ufe0f Doesn't detect overfitting (memorization)\n",

    "### 4.2 Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea**: Compare real and fake distributions in Inception feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Pass real images through Inception model \u2192 features $\\mu_r, \\Sigma_r$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Idea**: Separate quality from diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: Fraction of generated samples that match real distribution\n",
    "- High precision \u2192 high quality (realistic)\n",

    "- High precision, low recall: Only generates easy modes\n",
    "- Low precision, high recall: Generates everything, including bad samples\n",
    "- Goal: High both (quality AND diversity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Human Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gold Standard**: Ask humans to rate images\n",
    "- Show real vs fake, ask to classify\n",
    "- If humans can't tell \u2192 GAN is good\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol:**\n",
