    "**Problem solved**: Capture long-range dependencies without sequential processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"The agreement was signed after lengthy negotiations between the two companies.\"\n",

    "**Effect**: Model learns \"The cat chased the dog\" ≠ \"The dog chased the cat\"\n",

    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Head 1: Syntactic (subject-verb agreement)\n",

    "\n",
    "**✅ Use When**:\n",
    "- Text understanding tasks (classification, NER, Q&A)\n",
    "- Transfer learning available (pre-trained models)\n",
    "- Accuracy is critical (95%+ required)\n",
    "- Labeled data available (1,000+ examples)\n",
    "- Latency <100ms acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Don't Use When**:\n",
    "- Real-time streaming (<10ms latency required)\n",
    "- Very long sequences (>4K tokens) - use Longformer/BigBird instead\n",
    "- Tiny datasets (<100 examples) - use GPT few-shot instead\n",
    "- Edge devices (mobile/IoT) - use DistilBERT or TinyBERT\n",

    "## Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Model Selection**:\n",
    "- [ ] Choose base model size (base vs large)\n",
    "- [ ] Consider distilled versions (DistilBERT, TinyBERT)\n",
    "- [ ] Evaluate domain-specific pre-training (BioBERT, FinBERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Fine-Tuning**:\n",
    "- [ ] Collect 1,000+ labeled examples per class\n",
    "- [ ] Split data: 80% train, 10% val, 10% test\n",
    "- [ ] Train for 3-5 epochs (avoid overfitting)\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor validation loss (early stopping)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Optimization**:\n",
    "- [ ] Apply quantization (INT8) for 4× speedup\n",
    "- [ ] Export to ONNX for cross-platform deployment\n",
    "- [ ] Use TensorRT for GPU inference (5× speedup)\n",
    "- [ ] Batch requests for throughput (32-64 samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Deployment**:\n",
    "- [ ] Set up model serving (TorchServe, TF Serving)\n",
    "- [ ] Implement API (FastAPI, Flask)\n",
    "- [ ] Add monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)\n",
    "- [ ] Configure auto-scaling (Kubernetes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Monitoring**:\n",
    "- [ ] Track latency (p50, p95, p99)\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor accuracy on production data\n",
    "- [ ] Alert on performance degradation\n",
    "- [ ] Retrain periodically (monthly recommended)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**You now have**:\n",
    "1. ✅ Mathematical understanding (self-attention, multi-head attention)\n",
    "2. ✅ Implementation skills (from scratch + Hugging Face)\n",
    "3. ✅ Production deployment knowledge (ONNX, TensorRT, quantization)\n",
    "4. ✅ Real-world project templates (8 production applications)\n",
    "5. ✅ Business value quantification ($175M-$525M/year across projects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue learning**:\n",
    "- **Next notebook**: GPT & Large Language Models (generative pre-training)\n",
    "- **Advanced topics**: Long-context transformers (Longformer, BigBird)\n",
    "- **Cutting-edge**: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA fine-tuning\n",
