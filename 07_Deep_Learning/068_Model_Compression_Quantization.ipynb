    "Observation: Neural networks are OVER-PARAMETERIZED",

    "- BERT-Base: 110M parameters, but 40M sufficient (DistilBERT)",
    "- GPT-3: 175B parameters, but 40B sufficient (compressed models)",
    "",
    "Why? Training dynamics: Over-parameterization helps optimization (wider basins)",
    "Deployment: Once trained, many parameters are redundant (can be removed)",
    "",
    "Analogy: Scaffolding for construction",
    "- Training: Need scaffolding (over-parameterization) to build",
    "- Deployment: Remove scaffolding (pruning), building stands",

    "- Pruning small weights: Negligible impact on predictions",
    "",
    "#### **3. Structured Pruning (Filter-Level)**",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u274c Pitfall 1: One-Shot Pruning\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Prune 90% at once\n",
    "prune_90_percent(model)\n",
    "fine_tune(model, epochs=5)  # Hard to recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Iterative pruning (gradual compression)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Gradual pruning\n",
    "for sparsity in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85, 0.9]:\n",
    "    prune_to_sparsity(model, sparsity)\n",
    "    fine_tune(model, epochs=2)  # Easier to recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u274c Pitfall 2: No Hardware Support\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Quantize to INT8 but run on CPU without VNNI\n",
    "model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "# Result: Slower than FP32! (INT8 dequantized to FP32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Verify hardware support\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Check for INT8 support\n",
    "if torch.backends.quantized.engine == 'fbgemm':  # x86 VNNI\n",
    "    model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No INT8 support, use FP32\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u274c Pitfall 3: Pruning After Quantization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Quantize then prune (quantization loses sparsity)\n",
    "model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "prune(model_int8)  # No effect! INT8 can't represent exact zeros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Prune first, then quantize\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Prune \u2192 Fine-tune \u2192 Quantize\n",
    "prune(model)\n",
    "fine_tune(model)\n",
    "quantize(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u2705 1. Iterative Compression\n",
    "- Start conservative (50% sparsity), gradually increase\n",
    "- Fine-tune after each pruning step (2-5 epochs)\n",
    "- Monitor accuracy drop (<1% acceptable, >3% investigate)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u2705 2. Per-Channel Quantization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Better: Per-channel scale (separate per filter)\n",
    "for i in range(num_channels):\n",
    "    scale[i] = max(abs(weights[i])) / 127\n",
    "    weights_int8[i] = round(weights[i] / scale[i])\n",
    "\n",
    "# vs Global scale (single for all filters)\n",
    "scale = max(abs(weights)) / 127  # Suboptimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Different channels have different ranges (e.g., [\u22120.1, 0.1] vs [\u22125, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u2705 3. Calibration Data for PTQ\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use representative data (not random)\n",
    "calibration_data = train_data.sample(1000)  # Not val_data!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cover diverse scenarios\n",
    "calibration_data = [\n",
    "    indoor_images,   # Different lighting\n",
    "    outdoor_images,  # Different ranges\n",
    "    night_images     # Edge cases\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### \u2705 4. Validate on Target Device\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Don't trust simulation\n",
    "latency_sim = 45ms  # Simulated\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measure on real device\n",
    "with torch.no_grad():\n",
