    "\n",
    "### \u274c When NOT to Use BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text generation** (use GPT-2/3): BERT is encoder-only, not generative\n",
    "2. **Ultra-low latency (<10ms)**: Even DistilBERT takes 10-25ms\n",
    "3. **Tiny datasets (<100 examples)**: Consider few-shot GPT-3 instead\n",
    "4. **Long documents (>512 tokens)**: Use Longformer or hierarchical BERT\n",
    "5. **Multilingual with 100+ languages**: Use XLM-R (94 languages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \ud83c\udfaf Transfer Learning Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always start with pre-trained BERT**: Never train from scratch (waste of compute)\n",
