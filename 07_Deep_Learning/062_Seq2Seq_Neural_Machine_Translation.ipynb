    "\n",
    "### **Technical Insights**\n",
    "1. **Attention is crucial**: Vanilla Seq2Seq (no attention) achieves BLEU ~35, with attention ~40-45\n",
    "2. **Beam search matters**: +2-3 BLEU points over greedy, but 3-5x slower\n",
    "3. **Subword tokenization essential**: Handles OOV words (BPE, SentencePiece)\n",
    "4. **Transformers replaced RNNs**: Faster training (parallel), better quality, but Seq2Seq concepts remain fundamental\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Production Lessons**\n",
    "1. **Data quality > model size**: 10K high-quality pairs beat 100K noisy pairs\n",
    "2. **Domain adaptation works**: Fine-tune general models on domain data (5-10x better)\n",
    "3. **Hybrid human+AI optimal**: NMT + human post-editing cheaper than pure human\n",
    "4. **Monitor continuously**: Translation quality degrades as language evolves\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Impact**\n",
    "1. **Massive ROI**: 20-50x returns common for high-value tasks\n",
    "2. **Fastest payback**: Projects saving engineer time (weeks to payback)\n",
    "3. **Portfolio approach**: 8 projects diversify risk, ensure 3-5 succeed\n",
    "4. **Start small**: Prove value with 1K examples, scale to 100K+\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- **Code generation** (GitHub Copilot predecessor)\n",
