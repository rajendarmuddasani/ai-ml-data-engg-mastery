    "### Mathematical Foundations Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Approximation**: Neural networks enable RL to scale (universal approximation theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deadly Triad**: Function approximation + bootstrapping + off-policy = instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DQN Innovations**:\n",
    "   - Experience replay: Break correlation, improve sample efficiency\n",
    "   - Target networks: Stabilize TD targets\n",
    "   - Result: First superhuman Deep RL (Atari 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Double DQN: Reduce overestimation (decouple selection/evaluation)\n",
    "   - Dueling DQN: Separate V(s) and A(s,a) (faster learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Policy Gradients**:\n",
    "   - Theorem: $\\nabla_\\theta J = \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla \\log \\pi \\cdot A]$\n",
    "   - PPO: Clipped objective for safe policy updates\n",
    "   - Used in ChatGPT RLHF\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Maximum Entropy RL**:\n",
    "   - SAC: Maximize return + entropy\n",
    "   - Automatic temperature tuning\n",
    "   - State-of-the-art continuous control\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Convergence**: Guaranteed for tabular/linear, empirical for deep RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Rigor vs. Empirical Success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep RL paradox**: Best algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC) have **no convergence guarantees**, yet achieve superhuman performance!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson**: Engineering insights (target networks, clipping) often more valuable than theoretical guarantees.\n",
