    "# 069: Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federated Learning** is a distributed machine learning paradigm where **training occurs on decentralized edge devices** (smartphones, hospitals, factories) **without sharing raw data**. Instead of centralizing data in a single server, the model travels to the data, learns locally, and only shares model updates (gradients/weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "This revolutionary approach solves critical challenges in privacy, regulation, and data centralization that plague traditional machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Federated Learning Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Centralization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional ML Pipeline (Centralized):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Medical Records (Hospital A) ──┐\n",
    "Medical Records (Hospital B) ──┼──> Central Server ──> Train Model ──> Deploy\n",
    "Medical Records (Hospital C) ──┘\n",
    "                                ❌ Privacy violation\n",
    "                                ❌ GDPR/HIPAA non-compliant\n",
    "                                ❌ Data transfer costs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "1. **Privacy violation**: Raw patient data leaves hospitals\n",
    "2. **Regulatory compliance**: GDPR (€20M fine), HIPAA (criminal charges)\n",
    "3. **Data transfer costs**: Petabytes to cloud ($0.09/GB × 1PB = $90K)\n",
    "4. **Latency**: Centralized training delayed by data collection\n",
    "5. **Single point of failure**: Server breach exposes all data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Impact:**\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Cannot aggregate patient data across hospitals (HIPAA)\n",
    "- **Finance**: Cannot share transaction data across banks (PCI-DSS)\n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: Cannot share production data with competitors (trade secrets)\n",
    "- **Mobile AI**: Cannot send user keyboard predictions to cloud (privacy)\n",

    "### Federated Learning Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federated Pipeline:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hospital A: Train on local data ──> Send gradients ──┐\n",
    "Hospital B: Train on local data ──> Send gradients ──┼──> Central Server\n",
    "Hospital C: Train on local data ──> Send gradients ──┘         ↓\n",

    "## 🔧 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Federated Averaging (FedAvg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Algorithm:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "For t = 1 to T (rounds):\n",
    "    Server selects K devices from N total\n",
    "    Server sends global model θₜ to K devices\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For each device k:\n",
    "        θₖ ← LocalTrain(θₜ, Dₖ, E epochs)\n",
    "        Send Δθₖ = θₖ - θₜ to server\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Server aggregates:\n",
    "    θₜ₊₁ ← θₜ + Σₖ (nₖ/n) Δθₖ  [weighted by dataset size nₖ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Works:**\n",
    "- **Intuition**: Average of local models approximates centralized model\n",
    "- **Theory**: Converges to same optimum as centralized (if data is IID)\n",
    "- **Practice**: 95-99% of centralized accuracy (even with non-IID data)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non-IID Data Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Device data is not identically distributed (Non-IID)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Medical):**\n",
    "- Hospital A: 90% elderly patients (diabetes common)\n",
    "- Hospital B: 70% young patients (diabetes rare)\n",
    "- Hospital C: 50% urban (different risk factors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**: Local models diverge, aggregation is suboptimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **FedProx**: Add regularization to keep local models close to global\n",
    "2. **Personalization**: Mix global + local model (80% global, 20% local)\n",
    "3. **Clustering**: Group similar devices, aggregate separately\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Communication Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Sending model updates every round is expensive (bandwidth, battery)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Gradient Compression**: Quantize gradients (32-bit → 8-bit) = 4× reduction\n",
    "2. **Sparsification**: Send only top-k gradients (1% largest) = 100× reduction\n",
    "3. **Local Epochs**: Train E=5 epochs locally before sending update (5× fewer rounds)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Google Gboard):**\n",
    "- Model size: 10MB (too large for frequent updates)\n",
    "- Compressed update: 100KB (100× smaller)\n",
    "- Frequency: Once per day (not every round)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Device Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Not all devices participate every round (battery, connectivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategies:**\n",
    "1. **Random Selection**: Choose K devices uniformly (simple, unbiased)\n",
    "2. **Stratified Sampling**: Ensure diverse data coverage (e.g., 20 hospitals per region)\n",
    "3. **Active Learning**: Select devices with highest gradient norms (most informative)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Total devices: 1M smartphones\n",
    "- Selected per round: 100 devices (0.01%)\n",
    "- Rounds: 1000 → 100K devices trained (10% of total)\n",

    "## When to Use Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use when:**\n",
    "1. **Privacy required**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS compliance\n",
    "2. **Data cannot be centralized**: Trade secrets, competitive sensitivity\n",
    "3. **Large-scale edge deployment**: Billions of devices (mobile, IoT)\n",
    "4. **Personalization needed**: Adapt to local data distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't use when:**\n",
    "1. **Data can be centralized**: No privacy/regulatory issues\n",
    "2. **Small number of devices**: <10 devices (overhead not justified)\n",
    "3. **Homogeneous data**: All devices have similar distributions\n",
    "4. **Real-time requirements**: <100ms latency (federated rounds take minutes)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Communication Efficiency\n",
    "- **Gradient compression** (top-k=1%, quantization INT8)\n",
    "- **Local epochs** (E=5-10, reduce communication frequency)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Privacy Guarantees\n",
    "- **Differential privacy** (ε=3-8, moderate privacy)\n",
    "- **Secure aggregation** (homomorphic encryption for cross-silo)\n",
    "- **Gradient clipping** (C=1.0, bound sensitivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Robustness\n",
    "- **Robust aggregation** (Krum, Trimmed Mean for Byzantine attacks)\n",
    "- **Client validation** (detect malicious updates)\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection** (flag outlier updates)\n",
