    "- Each agent maintains its own Q-table: Q^i(s, a^i)\n",

    "### 1. Training Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Play**:\n",
    "- \u2705 When: Cooperative or competitive symmetric games\n",
    "- \u2705 Benefit: Automatic curriculum (agents improve together)\n",
    "- \u274c Risk: Mode collapse (converge to single strategy)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Population-based training (maintain diversity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**:\n",
    "- \u2705 When: Partial observability, need coordination\n",
    "- \u2705 Benefit: Stable training (centralized) + scalable deployment (decentralized)\n",
    "- \u274c Risk: Train-test mismatch (agents assume perfect communication during training)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Add communication dropout during training\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Communication Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to communicate**:\n",
    "- \u2705 High-bandwidth available (warehouse WiFi, data center)\n",
    "- \u2705 Coordination critical (autonomous vehicles at intersection)\n",
    "- \u274c Bandwidth limited (satellite swarms, underwater robots)\n",
    "- \u274c Latency high (>100ms)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to communicate**:\n",
    "- **Observations**: Share local views (increase information)\n",
    "- **Actions**: Broadcast intentions (reduce collisions)\n",
    "- **Gradients**: Centralized training only (not deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learned communication** (CommNet, TarMAC):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CommNet(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, observations):\n",
    "        # observations: (batch, n_agents, obs_dim)\n",
    "        h = self.encoder(observations)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Communication rounds\n",
    "        for layer in self.comm_layers:\n",
    "            # Average pooling (broadcast)\n",
    "            comm = h.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True).expand_as(h)\n",

    "### 3. Safety and Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety constraints**:\n",
    "- **Hard constraints**: Emergency stop (autonomous vehicles: <50ms response)\n",
    "- **Soft constraints**: Penalty in reward function (collision penalty: -1000)\n",
    "- **Shielding**: Verify RL action against safety rules, override if unsafe\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness to agent failure**:\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: N+1 agents (1 failure tolerated)\n",
    "- **Graceful degradation**: Agents detect failure, redistribute tasks\n",
    "- **Independent fallback**: If communication fails, use independent policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adversarial robustness**:\n",
    "- **Worst-case training**: Train against adversarial opponents\n",
    "- **Ensemble policies**: Use multiple policies, vote on action\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: Detect unusual agent behavior, quarantine\n",

    "## \u26a0\ufe0f Common MARL Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Relative Overgeneralization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Agents learn strategy that works well against current teammates, but poorly against others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: In cooperative navigation, agents learn to always go clockwise around obstacle (works if all agents agree, fails if mixed with agents going counter-clockwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Population-based training (train against diverse agents)\n",
    "- Add noise to teammate policies during training\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Lazy Agent Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: In cooperative setting, one agent learns to do all work, others do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Predator-prey with 3 predators: 1 predator chases, 2 predators stay still (lazy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Individual rewards (not just team reward)\n",
    "- Dropout: Randomly remove agents during training (forces all to be useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Communication Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Agents communicate too much (wasting bandwidth).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: 100 robots broadcast position every timestep \u2192 10,000 messages/second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Learn **when** to communicate (gating mechanism)\n",
    "- Compress messages (learned encoding)\n",
    "- Local communication only (graph structure)\n",
