    "## **What is Reinforcement Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a machine learning paradigm where an **agent** learns to make sequential decisions by **interacting with an environment** to maximize **cumulative rewards**. Unlike supervised learning (which learns from labeled examples) or unsupervised learning (which finds patterns), RL learns through **trial and error**.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Markov Decision Process** is a 5-tuple: **MDP = (S, A, P, R, γ)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Space (S)**: Set of all possible states\n",
    "   - Discrete: S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ}\n",
    "   - Continuous: S ⊆ ℝⁿ\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Action Space (A)**: Set of all possible actions\n",
    "   - Discrete: A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ}\n",
    "   - Continuous: A ⊆ ℝᵐ\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transition Probability (P)**: P(s'|s, a)\n",
    "   - Probability of reaching state s' after taking action a in state s\n",
    "   - Must satisfy: Σ_{s'∈S} P(s'|s,a) = 1 for all s, a\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reward Function (R)**: R(s, a, s') or R(s, a) or R(s)\n",
    "   - Immediate reward for transition\n",
    "   - Can be deterministic or stochastic\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discount Factor (γ)**: 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1\n",
    "   - Balances immediate vs future rewards\n",
    "   - γ = 0: Only immediate rewards matter (myopic)\n",
    "   - γ = 1: All future rewards equally important (far-sighted)\n",
