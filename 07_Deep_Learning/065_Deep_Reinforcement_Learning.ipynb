    "\n",
    "**Welcome to Deep RL!** This notebook extends the fundamentals from notebook 064 (Q-Learning, REINFORCE) to **deep reinforcement learning** algorithms that handle high-dimensional state spaces (images, complex sensor data) and achieve superhuman performance on challenging tasks.\n",

    "## **🎯 Why Deep RL Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Breakthrough Moment: DQN (2013)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013, DeepMind published *\"Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning\"*, demonstrating that a single neural network could learn to play 49 Atari games from raw pixels—no hand-crafted features, just pixels → actions. This was the birth of **Deep RL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What changed?**\n",
    "- **Before DQN**: RL limited to low-dimensional state spaces (< 1000 states)\n",
    "  - FrozenLake: 16 states ✅ (tabular Q-learning works)\n",
    "  - Atari: 256^(84×84×4) ≈ 10^67,000 states ❌ (tabular impossible)\n",
    "- **After DQN**: Neural networks approximate Q-function → scales to complex environments\n",
    "  - Atari: CNN processes pixels → Q-values for 18 actions\n",
    "  - AlphaGo (2016): Neural networks + MCTS → Beat world Go champion\n",
    "  - OpenAI Five (2019): LSTM + PPO → Beat Dota 2 world champions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Impact:**\n",
    "- **Robotics**: Boston Dynamics uses PPO for quadruped locomotion (Spot robot)\n",

    "## **💡 When to Use Deep RL**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Use Deep RL When:**\n",
    "1. **High-dimensional state spaces** (images, sensor data)\n",
    "   - Atari: 84×84×4 pixels\n",
    "   - Robotics: 100+ joint angles, forces, torques\n",
    "   - Manufacturing: 500+ parameters (equipment status, WIP levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequential decision-making** (multi-step optimization)\n",
    "   - Not one-shot prediction (use supervised learning)\n",
    "   - Long-term consequences matter\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction with environment** (online learning)\n",
    "   - Can simulate environment (manufacturing, games)\n",
    "   - Or safely explore real environment (robotics with safety constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No labeled optimal actions** (trial-and-error needed)\n",
    "   - Supervised learning requires (state, optimal_action) pairs\n",
    "   - RL learns from rewards (no need for optimal labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **❌ Don't Use Deep RL When:**\n",
    "1. **Low-dimensional state spaces** (< 100 dimensions)\n",
    "   - Use tabular Q-learning or linear function approximation (faster, simpler)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labeled data available** (supervised learning better)\n",
    "   - RL requires 10-100× more data than supervised learning\n",
    "   - If you have (state, action) labels → use imitation learning or supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploration dangerous/expensive** (safety-critical)\n",
    "   - Medical treatment: Can't explore random treatments on patients\n",
    "   - Autonomous driving: Can't crash cars during training\n",
    "   - Use offline RL (learn from logged data) or model-based RL (learn in simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-time constraints** (< 1ms inference)\n",
    "   - Neural networks slower than tabular lookup (1-10ms vs 0.01ms)\n",
    "   - Use model compression (quantization, pruning) or hybrid systems\n",

    "A3C Key Innovations:\n",
    "1. **Multiple Parallel Workers:**\n",
    "   - Launch N workers (e.g., 16 CPU threads)\n",
    "   - Each worker interacts with its own environment copy\n",
    "   - Workers run asynchronously (no waiting)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shared Global Network:**\n",
    "   - All workers share same actor-critic network parameters\n",
    "   - Workers compute gradients locally\n",
    "   - Asynchronously update global network (thread-safe)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantage Function:**\n",
    "   - Same as Actor-Critic: A(s,a) = R + γV(s') - V(s)\n",
    "   - Reduces variance compared to raw returns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why Asynchronous:**\n",
    "   - Decorrelates experiences (different workers see different states)\n",
    "   - No need for experience replay buffer (saves memory)\n",
    "   - Faster wall-clock time (parallel execution)\n",
    "   - More stable than single-threaded Actor-Critic\n",

    "- **Large-scale:** 1M transitions (Atari DQN)\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Larger buffer = more memory, better decorrelation\n",

    "**3. Target Network Update Frequency:**\n",

    "- **Soft update:** τ = 0.001-0.01 every step (DDPG, TD3)\n",

    "### ⚙️ Training Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameter Tuning Priority:**\n",
    "1. **Learning rate** (most impactful): Start with 1e-3, adjust by 10x\n",
    "2. **Discount factor γ**: 0.99 (long-term), 0.9 (short-term), 0.95 (medium)\n",
    "3. **Exploration rate ε**: Start 1.0, decay to 0.01-0.1\n",
    "4. **Batch size**: 32-128 (larger = more stable, slower)\n",
    "5. **Replay buffer size**: Based on memory constraints\n",

    "**Reward Shaping:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    reward += 10  # Substantial but not overwhelming bonus\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 1: Reward too sparse → Agent never learns**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 2: High variance in policy gradients → Unstable training**\n",

    "advantages = (advantages - np.mean(advantages)) / (np.std(advantages) + 1e-8)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 3: Overestimation bias in Q-learning → Divergence**\n",
    "- **Symptom:** Q-values explode to unrealistic values, then collapse\n",
    "- **Solution:** Double DQN, clipped double Q-learning (TD3)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 4: Catastrophic forgetting → Performance suddenly drops**\n",

    "replay_buffer = deque(maxlen=100000)  # Was 10000\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pitfall 5: Not enough exploration → Stuck in local optimum**\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Iteration 100: Policy plays well (return = 500)\n",
    "- Iteration 101: Large gradient update → policy changes drastically\n",
    "- Iteration 101: Policy plays poorly (return = 50)\n",
    "- Iteration 102: Try to recover, but difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Happens:**\n",
    "- Policy gradient: ∇_θ J(θ) = E[∇_θ log π_θ(a|s) A(s,a)]\n",
    "- If advantage A(s,a) large → gradient large → policy change large\n",

    "Modern semiconductor fabs process 300-500 steps per wafer with complex tool dependencies and stochastic processing times. Current rule-based scheduling (FIFO, EDD) achieves only 65-75% equipment utilization and 70+ day cycle times, resulting in $50M-$120M/year opportunity cost per $5B fab.\n",

    "#### **Problem Statement**\n",

    "- Minimize cycle time (target: 70 → 50 days, 28% reduction)\n",
    "- Maximize equipment utilization (target: 70% → 85%, 15% increase)\n",

    "**Architecture: Multi-Agent PPO**\n",
    "- **State space (500D):**\n",
    "  - Equipment status: 10-20 tool groups × (idle/busy, utilization%, time_to_available, maintenance_due)\n",
    "  - Wafer lot status: 50-100 lots × (current_step, remaining_steps, due_date, priority, processing_time_estimate)\n",
    "  - WIP levels: Work-in-progress per tool group\n",
    "  - Temporal features: Time-of-day, shift, day-of-week (fab operates 24/7)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Action space (100D discrete or 50D continuous):**\n",
    "  - Discrete: Select which lot to process next for each tool group (one-hot encoding)\n",
    "  - Continuous: Priority scores for each lot (softmax to get probabilities)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reward function:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  reward = -w1 * cycle_time \n",
    "           - w2 * tardiness_penalty \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Multi-agent coordination:**\n",
    "  - One PPO agent per tool group (10-20 agents)\n",
    "  - Shared critic network (centralized training, decentralized execution - CTDE)\n",
    "  - Communication protocol: Agents share downstream WIP levels and urgent lots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Setup:**\n",
    "- Environment: Custom Gym environment wrapping discrete-event simulator (SimPy)\n",
    "- Simulator: 300 processing steps, 20 tool groups, 100 wafer lots, stochastic processing times (log-normal distribution)\n",
    "- Training: 100K episodes, 2-4 hours on 8×V100 GPUs\n",
    "- Validation: 10K episodes on held-out fab configurations\n",
    "- Baseline: FIFO (First-In-First-Out), EDD (Earliest Due Date), CR (Critical Ratio)\n",
