# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful**: Treating all individuals with respect and kindness
- **Being constructive**: Providing thoughtful, actionable feedback
- **Being collaborative**: Working together toward shared learning goals
- **Being inclusive**: Welcoming learners at all skill levels
- **Being professional**: Maintaining technical discussions focused on ideas, not individuals
- **Acknowledging contributions**: Giving credit where credit is due

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Spamming or excessive self-promotion
- Using sexualized language or imagery
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub repository, issues, discussions, pull requests) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
- Opening a private issue on GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Consequences

1. **Correction**: Private written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation
2. **Warning**: Formal warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary suspension from any interaction with the community
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from community participation
